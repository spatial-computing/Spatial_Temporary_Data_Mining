Researchers and their supporters perceived the fuel cell as a hybrid of the conventional galvanic battery and the internal combustion engine, combining the advantages of both without their handicaps. In conventional storage batteries, the electrodes are also the \"fuel\", and are gradually consumed over time. In contrast, fuel cells use chemical reactants that are stored externally, not within the battery casing itself. Researchers assumed that as long as fuel was supplied, fuel cell electrodes and electrolyte would continue to operate with no chemical deterioration, a state known as \"invariance\".","arnumber":"4510265","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Fuel cell research and development and the pursuit of the technological panacea, 1940\u20132005]]>","partnum":"4510265","pubtitle":"Electric Power, 2007 IEEE Conference on the History of","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4510265","epage":"191","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4510265&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"1","punumber":"4483790","publicationid":"4510265","doi":"10.1109\/HEP.2007.4510265"}},{"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4510259&contentType=Conference+Publications":{"author":[{"name":"Eduardo I.

A commercially available Ballard Nexa (43-26 V, 1.2 kW) PEMFC fuel cell along with suitable DC\/DC and DC\/AC power electronic converter modules is employed. The proposed topology provides stable power to the load when the utility is interrupted. The design considerations include: obtaining an electrical equivalent circuit for fuel cell to facilitate the mathematical analysis of interactions between the fuel cell internal impedance and DC\/DC converter. The analysis presented provides a design methodology to check for steady state and transient stability of fuel cell and DC\/DC converter interaction in closed loop control to regulate the output DC voltage. For this example system it is shown that the fuel cell's dominant time constant is load dependent and varies from 8.97 ms (light load) to 20.37 ms (full load) resulting in fuel cells relatively slow dynamic response. Design inequalities are reviewed to better understand the interaction between the DC\/DC converter, fuel cell and potential instability conditions. Finally, a supercapacitor module is incorporated to overcome the electrical transients such as instantaneous power fluctuations, slow dynamics of the fuel processor and overload conditions. Energy stored in the supercapacitor is also utilized to handle a momentary overload for a short duration. It is shown that the supercapacitor value calculated for overload conditions are sufficient to enhance stability and improve dynamics respond of the fuel cell. Due to the absence of batteries the system satisfies the demand for an environmentally friendly clean source of energy. A complete design example illustrating the amount of hydrogen storage required for 1 hour power outage and sizing of supercapacitors for transient load demand is presented for a 1.5 kVA UPS.","arnumber":"4523000","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Design considerations for fuel cell powered UPS]]>","partnum":"4523000","pubtitle":"Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition, 2008.

Further, the fuel cell runs continuously to supply 10% power in steady state. In case of power outage, it is shown that the startup time for fuel cell is reduced and the supercapacitor bank supplies power till the fuel cell ramps up from supplying 10% load to 100% load. A detailed design example is presented for a 200 W\/350 VA 1-phase UPS system to meet the requirements of a critical load. The equivalent circuit and hence the terminal behavior of the fuel cell and the supercapacitor are considered in the analysis and design of the system for stable operation over a wide range.

In this paper a dynamic electrochemical model is developed to simulate a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) system to allow the development and improvement of electrical energy generation systems using this new promising technology. Although other models have been produced but most of these capture the fuel cell (FC) steady state behaviour by estimating its voltage for a particular set of operating conditions. The proposed model allows the incorporation of effects of different dynamic conditions in load current, pressure of input reactant gases, fuel cell operating temperature as well as the mass\/heat transfer transient features in the fuel cell body. Its capability of predicting transient dynamics will also prove useful when attempting to develop a control strategy. The proposed model strength is modularizing the fundamental thermal- physical behaviour of a fuel cell and developing a modular block that can be used as a part of any other schematic solution required for fuel cells' study. The developed modular block (prototype) exhibits most of the basic fuel cell properties and incorporates essential physical and electrochemical processes that happen along its operation, allowing its' easy moderation for modelling other fuel cells with different cell parameters and allow investigation of their behaviour for any operating or design configuration. The prototype can be useful in future in studying the integration of fuel cells into distribution power systems. The proposed modular block is implemented in SIMULINK and is verified by generating model results and comparing this to benchmark results for a Ballard NEXAtrade Power - - module. The proposed model was also compared to another simplified model; sample results for a Ballard V PEMFC were generated for both models indicating that the developed model is more accurate in simulating the fuel cell especially at high operating current densities.","arnumber":"4562321","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[A simplified dynamic simulation model (prototype) for a stand-alone Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) fuel cell stack]]>","partnum":"4562321","pubtitle":"Power System Conference, 2008.

If this gas is used as feedstock for a PEM fuel cell, it is possible to convert biomass to electricity in an environmental friendly way. A disadvantage of a PEM fuel cell is that platinum, which is used as catalyst to speed up the anode reaction, is a good adsorbent for CO. Carbon monoxide will adhere to the platinum surface blocking the catalyst for hydrogen oxidation. In order to clean the catalyst, oxygen can be added to the fuel stream. By applying negative voltage pulses to the cell terminals, existing water can get electrolyzed. This results in trace amounts of oxygen in the anode channel. Measurements performed on a poisoned fuel cell stack have been conducted. The results of the measurements show that the poisoned cells regenerate after a negative pulse. By optimizing the pulse amplitude, repetition time and duty cycle, the fuel cell used is CO-tolerant for gasses containing 50 ppm CO. Furthermore, cell oscillations, probably related to self-oxidation of carbon monoxide, are observed, which is remarkable for PEM fuel cells with pure platinum loaded catalysts.","arnumber":"4375023","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[CO-tolerant operation of platinum-loaded PEM fuel cells]]>","partnum":"4375023","pubtitle":"Industrial Electronics, 2007.

A variety of energy converters (such as inverters or rectifiers) are required in order to implement such a system. The fuel cell offers a sustainable approach to a CO<sub>2<\/sub>-reduced power supply; given its high level of efficiency, it is also an ideal substitute for diesel generators with electricity generation.

The following systems were inspected and analyzed: (i)1 MC (molten carbonate) fuel cell as permanent power supply (ii) PEM (polymer membrane) fuel cells as backup instead of a battery (two of them in the soccer stadium at the World Cup 2006) (iii) SO (solid oxide) fuel cells as permanent power supply Results from the projects currently indicate that the PEM and the MC fuel cells are approaching market maturity.

The main characteristic of the proposed topology is the use of fewer components when compared to the conventional two-stage power conditioners approach reducing the cost. In addition, the total efficiency is increased by reducing the power processing stages. Therefore, it is expected that the proposed integrated power conditioner topology could be effectively utilized for fuel cells applications.

Thereby the system cost, mass, and volume can be decreased, and a significant better performance can be obtained. Two often used energy storage devices are the battery and ultracapacitor. In this paper a design method to design the power system of a FCHEV is presented. 10 cases of combining the fuel stack with either the battery, ultracapacitor, or both are investigated. The system volume, mass, efficiency, and battery lifetime are also compared. It is concluded that when ultracapacitors are the only energy storage device the system becomes too big and heavy. A fuel cell\/battery\/ultracapacitor hybrid provides the longest life time of the batteries. If the fuel cell stack power is too small, the system will be big, heavy, and have a poor efficiency.","arnumber":"4658972","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Design and Comparison of Power Systems for a Fuel Cell Hybrid Electric Vehicle]]>","partnum":"4658972","pubtitle":"Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting, 2008.

In the past, lead acid batteries have dominated the backup power market for these sites and the power grid quality was considered robust. Katrina forced operators to look past this and it revealed that lead acid batteries typically only provide up to eight hours of backup for a site. For those sites where operators require extended runtime, a diesel generator was typically the only option. This paper will provide an overview of not only the diesel solution but also for a new solution that utilizes a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) and premium lead acid batteries to provide extended runtime at the site using a 5 kW base station plant, we will examine the architecture and design solutions that will give operators well over 48 hours of backup and in some cases over 160 hours. The PEMFC solution can utilize advanced lead acid front terminal batteries to ease maintenance as well as a robust and cost effective PEMFC engine. Critical areas for the mainstream success of fuel cells include total solution costs, reliability, fuel supply, maintenance and hydrogen storage. The comparative diesel will be the embedded 30 kW solution that is normally found in sites throughout these applications. Issues associated with generator operation include noise, emissions, permitting, fuel supply and maintenance costs will all be examined.

However, the fixed concentration fuel supply in existing DMFC systems relies on either the diluted methanol solution carrying or the active delivery driven by attached pump. Both approaches limit the power density or degrade the overall efficiency of the DMFC system significantly. Such disadvantages become more severe in small-scale DMFCs which require high conversion efficiency and small physical space suitable for portable electronics. In this paper, a passive fuel delivery component based on surface tension driving mechanism was designed and integrated in a laboratory-made prototype to achieve consumption depending fuel concentration control and power-free fuel delivery. The unidirectional methanol-to-water smooth flow is achieved through the capillaries of the Teflon PolyTetraFluoroEthylene (PTFE) membrane based on the difference in their properties of liquid surface tension. The prototype was demonstrated to exhibit a better polarization performance compared to the conventional DMFCs. Its high efficiency and load regulation performance was also proved in contrast with active DMFC fed with constant concentration fuel. The passive fuel delivery effect demonstrated here is believed to be more applicable for the future small scale DMFC development.","arnumber":"4380167","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Passive Direct Methanol Fuel Cell System with Adaptive Fuel Concentration Control based on Liquid Surface Tension]]>","partnum":"4380167","pubtitle":"Power Engineering, Energy and Electrical Drives, 2007.

The control system ideally gives priority to the photovoltanic solar cells before the fuel cell. When conditions allow for abundant sun light, the photovoltanic solar cell is used.

Fuel cell technology looks very promising for this application and several solutions are being proposed by various manufacturers, so Telecom Italia is continuing the program, testing different systems in order to evaluate their real performances and to determine parameters and requirements for a future standardization. All tests are performed in strict collaboration with the system's manufacturer and their results are shared and jointly evaluated. This paper deals with the tests performed on the ElectraGentrade system, manufactured by IdaTech and distributed in Italy by RENCO SpA. This system, expressly designed to provide stand-by power for critical power applications, uses a combination of a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell and energy storage devices (batteries or ultracapacitors) to provide uninterrupted backup power to an existing -48 volt DC power system. The system operates as a stand-by service and continuously monitors existing DC bus voltage. It can be configured both to respond instantly to voltage drops or for a delayed response to minimize fuel consumption when coupled with existing battery systems. The system is fueled by commercial grade (99.95% dry) hydrogen, supplied in standard hi pressure bottles or produced by a fuel processor via steam reforming of a water\/methanol mixture. The fuel reformer guarantees extended run times with a very compact fuel source. All the safety issues resulting from the transport and storage of hi-pressure hydrogen are overridden. As in a previous paper on this matter, the joint-authorship approach provides unique perspectives from both the manufacturer, IdaTech, and the end-user, Telecom Italia Spa, across the phases of the field trials.","arnumber":"4448749","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Field testing of fuel cells systems as backup power for Italian telecommunication sites]]>","partnum":"4448749","pubtitle":"Telecommunications Energy Conference, 2007.

Therefore, methods are needed to detect deviations from the chosen operating point before any damage to the stack or the environment occurs. In applications like vehicles, the fuel cell operation is highly dynamic, and special diagnosis cycles can not be used during operation. Thus, a diagnosis system is needed which uses the high dynamic data from operation. However, due to limitations of computational power, this diagnosis system must be as simple as possible. In this paper, the linear canonical variate analysis (CVA), which is a subspace identification method, is used as a means for modelling the non-linear PEMFC stack. The linear state-space models can be shown to represent well the input-output behavior of the stack. Additionally, two concepts are proposed using state-space models from linear CVA for diagnosis purposes.","arnumber":"4629629","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Modelling PEM fuel cell stacks for FDI using linear subspace identification]]>","partnum":"4629629","pubtitle":"Control Applications, 2008.

Accordingly, in this study, array micro sensors are fabricated within the fuel cell, in which the temperature and humidity distributions are measured. The substrate of the bipolar plate of the fuel cell was made of stainless steel (SS-304) and the wet etching was employed to fabricate the channel on the stainless steel substrate. Then microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology was used to fabricate the array micro temperature sensors and the micro humidity sensors on the rib of channel of stainless steel. The advantages of array micro temperature sensors are their small volume, their high accuracy, their short response time, the simplicity of their fabrication, their mass production and their ability to measure the temperature at a precise location more effectively than the traditional thermocouple.

A fuel cell system typically requires some kind of power conditioning that usually includes a DC-DC converter and a DC-AC inverter. In a single phase system, the operation of a single phase inverter introduces a second harmonic (120 Hz) current ripple into the system. This ripple has been found to be detrimental to the performance, life and efficiency of the fuel cell if it is not adequately controlled. This paper proposes an active filtering method to cancel the second harmonic current ripple drawn from the fuel cell source in a single phase fuel cell system. This approach provides an alternate path for the 120 Hz current preventing it from flowing through the fuel cell. The conventional and the proposed systems have been simulated using PSpice and the results have been presented. Experimental results from a laboratory prototype are also included to validate the proposed approach. A major feature of this implementation is the use of a DSP TMS 320F2808 for the overall control and monitoring of the system.","arnumber":"4596747","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[DSP-based control for reliable fuel cell power systems with input ripple current compensation]]>","partnum":"4596747","pubtitle":"Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century, 2008 IEEE","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4596747","epage":"4","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4596747&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"131","punumber":"4584435","publicationid":"4596747","doi":"10.1109\/PES.2008.4596747"}},{"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4581272&contentType=Conference+Publications":{"author":[{"name":"K.

The dc-ac inverter then produces 120\/240V ac using a CoolMOS based soft-switching inverter to achieve 98% peak efficiency. The inverter output is universal for both standalone and grid-tie modes operation. The standalone load comes out of two sets of LC filter with a neutral line for equal voltage splits. For grid-tie mode, a circuit breaker needs to turn on, and an additional inductor is included for grid current ripple reduction. Test results indicated that peak efficiency of 94% is achieved for the two-stage power conversion PCS. In addition to high efficiency design, this paper also introduces advanced controls including fuel cell current ripple reduction using a current loop in the dc-dc converter and ac output current steady-state error reduction using an admittance compensation technique in the dc-ac inverter.","arnumber":"4239198","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[A High-Efficiency 5-kW Soft-Switched Power Conditioning System for Low-Voltage Solid Oxide Fuel Cells]]>","partnum":"4239198","pubtitle":"Power Conversion Conference - Nagoya, 2007.

The more trivial case, startup of fuel cells that have been in standstill for a short time, has been investigated in three different tests. The special case, startup after long time standstill, has been investigated in three different tests. The fundamental impact of humidity on performance is discussed. It is necessary that there is a high water content (%RH) of the vital polymer membrane of the fuel cell - If high conductivity and high performance should be delivered. The results show reliable startup if the standstill time is short without any special actions taken. The results further show that it is possible to obtain a soft and reliable startup after long time of standstill.

In the hybrid direct fuel cell and turbine (DFC\/T) plant, the control system is an essential component that guarantees reliable and efficient operations. Being an effective complement for the local control scheme, a fault diagnosis and accommodation system based on fuzzy logic is implemented with the help of neural network augmenters, which improve the accuracy of the nominal model of the fuel cell plant. As a quantitative approach, the fuzzy fault diagnosis and accommodation system has considerably lower realization complexities than an analytical and detailed fault regulator.

They heavily rely upon a single type of energy carrier and thus are vulnerable to price and availability variations. In the article we introduce the multi-fuel syngas infrastructure. It comprises fuel flexible gasifiers, a gas distribution network and syngas conversion processes. At a fuel input rate of hundreds of petajoules it can convert the optimal mix of natural gas, oil, coal, biomass and residues simultaneously to the required product portfolio. The freedom to pick the cheapest energy source at any time results in a balanced and relative low syngas price. Due to the feedstock flexibility annual gross revenues can be expected - in the range of 1-10 billion dollars for world-scale clusters. A multi-fuel syngas infrastructure thus will significantly contribute to the growth, strength and continuity of seaport regions.","arnumber":"5439578","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Multi-fuel syngas infrastructures in seaports]]>","partnum":"5439578","pubtitle":"Infrastructure Systems and Services: Building Networks for a Brighter Future (INFRA), 2008 First International Conference on","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5439578","epage":"5","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5439578&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"175","punumber":"5410751","publicationid":"5439578","doi":"10.1109\/INFRA.2008.5439578"}},{"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4747174&contentType=Conference+Publications":{"author":[{"name":"J.

This allows for straightforward training of the NN using the global training method, which includes all power profiles to define an epoch. In addition to training the NN with all available data, the network's prediction capabilities were tested by training it with all but one dataset and then determining the prediction results based on the untrained dataset.

In general, the current- ripple in fuel cells give s damage to the fuel cell consumption and life span because the chemical reaction time is much slower than the commercial power source frequency. Therefore, the input current-ripple should be reduced in the DC-AC converter for fuel cells. In the conventional DC-AC converter, a large capacitor is inserted between the boost converter stage and the PWM inverter stage for the current- ripple reduction. This capacitor disturbs the size reduction of the converter unit. In the proposed topology, the first- stage boost converter provides a series of boosted voltage pulses directly to the second-stage PWM inverter. Therefore, a large capacitor for the smoothed DC power source is not needed. Instead, a series-connected LC circuit is inserted for the current-ripple reduction. This paper focuses the mechanism of current-ripple reduction. Moreover, an active method for the current-ripple reduction is proposed, which reduces the input current-ripple less than 1 Amp.","arnumber":"4592108","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Consideration for input current-ripple reduction on a novel pulse-link DC-AC converter for fuel cells]]>","partnum":"4592108","pubtitle":"Power Electronics Specialists Conference, 2008.

Based on the measurement of current and voltage of the stack, deviations of other parameters like gas pressure, stoichiometry, or humidification of the supplied air can be detected and isolated.","arnumber":"7068720","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Fault detection and isolation for PEM fuel cell stacks using fuzzy clusters]]>","partnum":"7068720","pubtitle":"Control Conference (ECC), 2007 European","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7068720","epage":"977","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7068720&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"190","punumber":"7065133","publicationid":"7068720","doi":""}},{"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4469044&contentType=Conference+Publications":{"author":[{"name":"A.

Several research works have been done in this area of power generation. In this paper, a dynamic model of a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell (FC) has been developed and the dynamic behaviors are studied. PEMFC has been chosen due its low operating temperature and little start-up time that is suitable for stationary applications like residential and transportation uses. This model uses fuzzy logic controller to replace conventional proportional-integral (PI) controller. Fuzzy logic control is used to the fuel flow to the reformer of the fuel cell system. The dynamic behavior of the fuel cell system with both the types of controllers i.e. FLC and PI are studied and compared. It is observed that the FLC functions as well as a PI controller and enhances the performance of the FC system. The dynamic behavior of the system is found to be more improved as compared with the PI controller system.","arnumber":"4469044","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Dynamic model of PEM fuel cell with fuzzy logic controller]]>","partnum":"4469044","pubtitle":"Universities Power Engineering Conference, 2007.

PEMFCs are considered as very promising alternative solution for energy generations in the future for stationary and mobile applications. In particular, they are the most favored fuel cell (FC) type to power electric vehicles of the future as a replacement for the internal combustion engine. The computation model based on the global nodal network method (GNNM) used to describe the thermal behavior presents high scalability and intrinsic parallel characteristics suitable for parallel implementation. The objective of this work is to develop a parallel implementation of GNNM using the Unified Parallel C (UPC) for a cluster of processors according to the distributed shared memory programming paradigm. UPC is an explicit parallel language that provides the facilities for direct user specification of program parallelism and control of data distribution and access to maximize performance. Due to its global address space, UPC simplify the management of ghost zones in large-scale simulations. Simulations results shows that computation time to conduct thermal behavior simulation is drastically reduced compared to sequential simulations and obtained simulation data are highly accurate and precise.","arnumber":"4728277","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Simulation of the Fuel Cell Thermal Behavior with Unified Parallel C]]>","partnum":"4728277","pubtitle":"Signal Processing and Communications, 2007.

Recent experimental and numerical investigations on PEM fuel cells identified water management as one of the most critical issues for designing robust, high-performance PEM fuel cells. Proper water management within the cell is therefore essential, as dehydration of the membrane or flooding of the cathode result in increasing resistive losses. Flooding reduction in the fuel cell is commonly done by removing water with excessive reactant (H<sub>2<\/sub> or O<sub>2<\/sub>) flow rates and elevated gas pressures. This mixture makes air delivery the largest parasitic load on fuel cells. Typically, this type of air delivery consumes more than 20% of the fuel cell power. As an alternative, we have developed a novel biased AC electroosmtic micropump for PEM fuel cell applications that can be fabricated with micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) compatible semiconductor microfabrication. This research paper will experimentally demonstrate the bi-directional pumping action that can prevent flooding, increase power density, and ensure stable performance of fuel cell by removing water from flooded regions and redistributing it to under-saturated regions. We also have developed an integrated complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) feedback circuit for the control of micropump.","arnumber":"4616892","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Biased AC electroosmosis micropump for water management in PEM fuel cells]]>","partnum":"4616892","pubtitle":"Circuits and Systems, 2008.

Furthermore, due to the sluggish dynamic response of fuel cell in transient events, there will be load following problem. In such cases, it is recommended to combine fuel cell with other electrical energy storage devices to satisfy sustained load demand and transient events. While batteries have low power densities and limited lifetime in highly cyclic application, ultracapacitors can be used. An ultracapacitor (UC) bank can supply a large burst of power but cannot store much energy. By operating the FC and UC in parallel, both steady state and peak power demands can be satisfied.

The basic approach was to overcome the limit of the current technology regarding cooling needs and energy consumption as well as maintenance costs and backup autonomy. In this perspective the following elements have been considered: to implement an active cooling with very low energy consumption or passive cooling, to backup the apparatus with fuel cell based power system, to integrate as much as possible both the technologies. Shelter cooling without air conditioning is possible with free-cooling and phase changing materials (PCM). Fuel cell based power systems give advantages in terms of wide range of accepted working temperature (from -5degC to 45degC) and very low maintenance needs. The fuel cell based power systems have been tested by several different Telecom operators but up to now very small activities have been performed for a complete integration into the shelter. In this application a 3 kW power system provides 24 hours of autonomy to all the equipments installed in the shelter. To accomplish to a complete integration work a new generation of power system has been generated: the new release consist in a 19rdquo core component equipped with fuel cell, power management and control system and a separated thermal split to dissipate the heat generated during the working time (backup). The result is a new generation of shelter with very interesting specifications. Experimental tests on the manufactured GreenShelter are in progress. Preliminary results confirm that in the same conditions of temperature and heat dissipation, the energetic gain of the GreenShelter solution can be up to 70% with respect to a traditional shelter with air conditioning. Not less important, the gain in terms of CapEx and OpEx could assest around 10% and 50divide70%, respectively.","arnumber":"4664059","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[GreenShelter for telecom applications a new generation of shelters for telecom applications integrating fuel cell electric backup and a new cooling approach]]>","partnum":"4664059","pubtitle":"Telecommunications Energy Conference, 2008.

A high CO rate is thus an important fault indicator, however, existing sensors for CO molar fraction measurement in a gas flow are not suited to on-board applications. It is then useful to design an algorithm for its estimation from available measurements.

The cell is designed for an air breathing cathode. On-demand hydrogen using chemical hydrides is the option taken for production as well as storage of the fuel, based on the high volumetric and gravimetric efficiency exhibited.

The desulfurization of fuel of fuels has been identified as a non-trivial obstacle to making fuel cells a viable alternative on the large scale. In this paper, we address one aspect of the problem of the desulphurization of fuel. We model the probability that a molecule of fuel will have its sulfur removed as it travels through the substrate. We develop a coarse, working model which can easily be tailored, focusing on the geometry of the system. Then we develop a more sophisticated model based on the initial geometry and the rates at which the sites will be used.","arnumber":"4380138","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Modeling the Probability of Fuel Desulfurization]]>","partnum":"4380138","pubtitle":"Power Engineering, Energy and Electrical Drives, 2007.

The onset potential of methanol oxidation on Pt-CeO<sub>2<\/sub> composite anode shifted to a lower potential and the activation energy of the Pt-CeO<sub>2<\/sub> composite anode for methanol oxidation reaction was lower than that of the Pt-Ru alloy anode. The high performance and low cost anode material could be obtained using nano size CeO<sub>2<\/sub> particles instead of Ru as rare metal. Importantly, the rare metal, Ru is not required in the present anode material and the amount of Pt required is also significantly reduced. As a consequence, we report a promising candidate Pt-CeO<sub>2<\/sub>\/CB composite anode for application in the development of direct methanol fuel cells or polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells.","arnumber":"4339177","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Development of high quality Pt-CeO2 composite anode for direct methanol fuel cell applications]]>","partnum":"4339177","pubtitle":"Polymers and Adhesives in Microelectronics and Photonics, 2007.

A particular interest has led to the possibility of producing energy in a stand alone configuration through the use of photovoltaic panels. This type of application still has some difficulties in storing produced energy since there isn't an alternative possibility to put energy in the electric grid. The proposed solution foresees the reduction of the use of the traditional batteries, replacing them with a system based on production and accumulation of hydrogen and on the reuse of hydrogen in a fuel cell system. The choice was focused on fuel cells system, 2000 W power, working at 48 VDC or 220 VAC with hydrogen-featuring a high purity level, and air taken from the surrounding environment. For the hydrogen storage, metal hydride reservoirs have been used, containing up to 1000 NI at very low pressure (up to 10 bars). The choice to manufacture small size power systems simplifies some issues related to the management of thermal flows and humidification of membranes so their use at a demonstration scale becomes immediately available. The purpose of this article is to provide a detailed description of the technical specifications adopted as a base for system design and to show the flexibility using this system. A special focus is assigned to hydrogen storage technology in metal hydride reservoirs, and to the techniques adopted to facilitate desorption during system operation. Finally, an analysis of the costs of installation and operation of the entire system is introduced, underlining the components that introduce great margins of decreasing in case of mass production.","arnumber":"4448813","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Low power hybrid fuel cells and photovoltaic systems for stand alone applications]]>","partnum":"4448813","pubtitle":"Telecommunications Energy Conference, 2007.

For the power generation from the glucose wastewater, both MFCs generated the steady voltage of 0.45~0.50 V. However compared to the MFC without suspended sludge, Coulombic efficiency of the MFC with suspended sludge was slight lower (2.3%-2.5%) than that without suspended sludge (2.9-3.1%) and the duration of stationary phase in each cycle with suspended sludge was 13.7~29.8% shorter than that of without suspended sludge. These results show that no obvious positive effect of suspended sludge on power generation was observed for MFC using glucose wastewater. When feces sewage was used, unlike the steady voltage (0.43-0.47 V) and Coulombic efficiency (3.5-3.9%) from MFC with suspended sludge, the working voltage (0.45-0.65 V) and Coulombic efficiency (1.5~4.3%) from the system without suspended sludge was fluctuant, therefore suspended sludge is necessary to obtain steady power output from more recalcitrant complex compounds.","arnumber":"4535943","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[The Effect of Suspended Sludge on Electricity Generation in Microbial Fuel Cells]]>","partnum":"4535943","pubtitle":"Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering, 2008.

A major challenge to the optimum operation of a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell lies in maintaining a certain humidification level of the electrolyte. For an optimal operation of a solid polymer fuel cell, correct humidification level of the membrane is desired to enable proton conductivity and prevent drying out with the consequent loss of fuel cell power. On the contrary, if the membrane is over humidified, the cell will flood - a condition in which the humidifying fluid blocks the flow of the reactants to the catalyst sites. To maintain an optimal operation range, a test is conducted at various temperatures, flow rates, current densities and stoichiometry with the intent of mapping the operational range of a 50 cm<sup>2<\/sup> proton exchange fuel cell with an externally mounted humidifier. The result reveals that a dew point temperature range of 65degC presents an acceptable range for the membrane tested.

A second order lead-lag compensator is proposed to avoid low stability margin while maintaining sufficient gain at the fundamental frequency. The proposed current loop controller and admittance compensation have been simulated, and the same parameters have been used for a DSP-based PCS inverter controller. Simulation results indicate that without the admittance path compensation, the duty cycle of the current loop controller is largely offset by the admittance path. At light load settings, the power flow may be erratically fed back to the inverter that can cause dc bus over voltage and subsequently a catastrophe failure.

These methods are shown for the current fed full bridge converter and the boost converter with autotransformer. The operating behaviour of the clamping circuits is shown and analysed. Also the semiconductor losses of the switches in the clamping circuit are derived for both converters. The general operating behaviour and the analysis is verified by simulation results and by practical results of two laboratory setups with a rated power of 20 kW.

This article proposes a suitable modulation strategy that complies with the low switching frequency requirement of the hybrid seven-level cascaded inverter power devices while fulfilling the required performance specifications of a fuel cell PCS. A particular advantage of this topology is that the modulation, control and protection requirements of each bridge are modular and it requires only a single dc source in each phase leg. For the cascaded multilevel inverter a variety of modulation strategies have been reported, with the most popular being carrier - based and space vector modulation (SVM). This paper focuses on the FPGA based carrier PWM method for the cascade multilevel inverter in PCS.

From the system perspective, the dynamic model of PEMFC can be expressed as a multivariable configuration of two inputs, hydrogen and air flow rates, and two outputs, cell voltage and current. The corresponding transfer function can be identified off-line to describe the linearized dynamics with a finite order at a certain operating point, and is written in a discrete-time auto-regression moving-average model for on-line estimation of parameters. This provides a basis of adaptive control strategy to improve the FC performance in terms of efficiency, transient and steady-state specifications.

Keeping the VSC on line during unbalanced voltage sags becomes thus a very critical issue. Hence, modeling, controller design, and simulation study of a hybrid distributed generation system are investigated. Based on the classification of unbalanced faults that can occur in the grid, resulting in voltage sags at the bus where the hybrid power system is connected, the maximum current that the converter valves must be bale to withstand is calculated.

This paper presents results of a study conducted on the technical aspects of a power supply system, in which wind power and solar PV energy are combined with hydrogen fuel cell. Although the power sources in this system are of intermittent nature, but because an energy storage technology (hydrogen) is incorporated into the system, the negative effects of intermittency would be minimal.

The FC model is tested on an experiment set which consists of three types of permanent magnet DC motor loads powered by the FC. The two of the motors are fan loaded and the other one is used in an experimental vehicle model. Steady-state input responses of each motor are modelled. Whole system is defined in MATLAB\/Simulink environment. The operating points (current and voltage) of the system for all motor loads are estimated by the general system model. According to the test results, relative errors between measured data and model predictions are about 0.01-5% for our sample test system.

Efficient, power-moded, fully integrated systems inherently demand high peak-to-average power ratios (PAPRs), as in wireless sensor applications where telemetry is a power-consuming function with low duty-cycle operation. Lithium ion batteries (Li-Ion), while conforming to micro-scale dimensions and supplying moderate power densities, cannot store enough energy to sustain extended lifetimes, which is where fuel cells (FCs) excel. Although various control strategies for energy flow between batteries and FCs have been proposed in the past, none of them superimpose the severe constraints of a micro-scale system on the design, where volume, energy, and power are scarce and the performance of the MEMS FCs degrade with time. This paper presents a hybrid micro-scale MEMS FC-thin-film Li-Ion source and proposes a design methodology for the same wherein volume, energy, and power are optimized for peak-power and extended-lifetime performance. The FC is ultimately used to both charge and supply the load asynchronously, depending on the state of the load, while the Li ion mostly functions as a power cache. System simulations of a multi-sensor wireless system load show and validate how peak-power, average-power, duty-cycle, and frequency performance are achieved and how they relate to lifetime.","arnumber":"4488669","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Design methodology of a hybrid micro-scale fuel cell-thin-film lithium ion source]]>","partnum":"4488669","pubtitle":"Circuits and Systems, 2007.

Controllers designed based on H<sub>infin<\/sub> linear control theory tend to exhibit orders higher than or equal to the order of the original system. In this contribution, two methods were utilized in order to obtain a low order linear MIMO state space model equivalent to the nonlinear automotive Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) power system developed in [2]. The principles of input-output system identification (prediction-error minimization) and balanced model order reduction were utilized. In the first method, a linear 8<sup>th<\/sup> order state space model was estimated to best reproduce the outputs of the nonlinear system. Model order was lowered one order at a time and a state space model was identified. The one step ahead prediction outputs of the linear modes (8<sup>th<\/sup> order through 4<sup>th<\/sup> order) were compared to the nonlinear model outputs of several input-output data sets. Outputs of the aforementioned linear models and the outputs of the nonlinear model were very closely matched. The identified 4<sup>th<\/sup> order linear model was deemed very suitable to represent the PEMFC system. In the second method, a balanced model order reduction technique was utilized to obtain a truncated 4<sup>th<\/sup> order linear model directly from the identified 8<sup>th<\/sup> order model obtained by the first method. The outputs of the truncated model and the outputs of the nonlinear model matched very well. Each of the 4<sup>th<\/sup> order models was capable of capturing the dynamics of the PEMFC system and each of their performances was deemed highly satisfactory. A simple yet effective H<sub>infin<\/sub> loop shaping power tracking controller was designed in order to set the net output power of the stack to its desired levels following dynamic changes in load demand by means of manipulating the input voltage of the c- - ompressor motor. The H<sub>infin<\/sub> compensated system exhibited faster transient response, less overshoot, higher robustness and lower sensitivity margins when compared to the results of basic feed forward controllers presented in [2], [4], and [10].","arnumber":"4554268","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[PEM fuel cell system identification and model order reduction for H<inf>infin;<\/inf> loop shaping controller design]]>","partnum":"4554268","pubtitle":"Electro\/Information Technology, 2008.

In this paper are proposed three novel methods to manage the power in a fuel cell powered electric vehicle by using the vehicle speed, the state of charge of supercapacitor and the dc-link voltage variation. Main result shows that in terms of an average high velocity variation, the voltage control gives a good performance compared with the current control topology. In contrast, during an average slow velocity changes, the current control gives a good performance mainly due to its natural slow response; and the hybrid configuration is suggested when high velocity changes are requested in the driving journey.","arnumber":"4544194","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Power Management Strategies for a Fuel Cell\/Supercapacitor Electric Vehicle]]>","partnum":"4544194","pubtitle":"Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference, 2007.

The output voltage of each fuel cell is about 0.4 V at full load and several of them are connected in series to construct a stack. An example 100 V fuel cell stack consists of 250 cells in series and to produce 300 V at full load requires 750 cells stacked in series. Since fuel cells actively convert the supplied fuel to electricity, each cell requires proper distribution of fuel, humidification, coupled with water\/thermal management needs. With this added complexity stacking more cells in series decreases the reliability of the system. For example, in the presence of bad or mal-performing cell\/cells in a stack, uneven heating coupled with variations in cell voltages may occur. Continuous operation under these conditions may not be possible or the overall stack output power is severely limited. In this paper a modular fuel cell powered by a modular DC-DC converter is proposed. The proposed concept electrically divides the fuel cell stack into various sections, each powered by a DC-DC converter. The proposed modular fuel cell powered by modular DC-DC converter eliminates many of these disadvantages, resulting in a fault tolerant system. A design example is presented for a 150 W, three section fuel cell stack and DC-DC converter topology. Experimental results obtained on a 150 W, three section PEM fuel cell stack powered by a modular DC-DC converter are discussed.","arnumber":"4342432","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[A Modular Fuel Cell, Modular DC-DC Converter Concept for High Performance and Enhanced Reliability]]>","partnum":"4342432","pubtitle":"Power Electronics Specialists Conference, 2007.

However, high cost of the per-fluorinated PEMs encouraged the development of the cheaper and better fluorinated or non-fluorinated PEMs. Radiation induced grafting of functional monomers into polymer films or membranes and successive sulfonation was designed as an alternative route to obtain the PEMs for PEFC applications. Typically, styrene and co-monomers like divinylbenzene were grafted into the fluorinated polymer films or membranes.

It enables: (a) removal of the DC-link filter evident in conventional inverters where the diode rectifier stage is followed by low-pass filter and a voltage-source inverter (VSI); (b) significant reduction in switching loss of the inverter by modulating the switches of 2 of the 3 legs of the 6-switch AC\/AC converter at 120 Hz while modulating the 3<sup>rd<\/sup> leg at high frequency. Unlike the VSI approach, in the DPC approach hybrid modulation enables the retention of the sine-wave modulated switching information at the output of the diode rectifier without rather than filtering it. Overall, the following is demonstrated: i) modulation scheme and uniqueness, and analytical derivation of the Fourier transformation of the output voltage; ii) derivation of a reachability condition for the DPC topology that outlines its global stability and performance; iii) demonstration of the switching and conduction losses and harmonics; and iv) scaled experimental validation. It is noted that, the term hybrid modulation has no similarity with the modulation scheme for a hybrid converter (which are conjugation of two types of converters based on a slow and fast device) reported in literature. The term hybrid modulation scheme is simply chosen because at any given time, only one leg of the inverter output stage carries out forced switching while the other two legs are not switching at all. The outlined hybrid modulation scheme is unlike all reported discontinuous modulation schemes where the input is a DC and not a pulsating modulated DC and at most only one leg stays on or off permanently in a 60deg or 120deg cycle.","arnumber":"4596911","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[A novel hybrid modulation scheme for an isolated high-frequency-link fuel cell inverter]]>","partnum":"4596911","pubtitle":"Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century, 2008 IEEE","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4596911","epage":"7","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4596911&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"327","punumber":"4584435","publicationid":"4596911","doi":"10.1109\/PES.2008.4596911"}},{"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4345811&contentType=Conference+Publications":{"author":[{"name":"Michael J.

Drexel Plasma Institute has developed a new type of fuel conversion reactor that utilizes a non-equilibrium gliding discharge (traditionally called \"Gliding Arc\" though it operates mostly in the glow discharge regime) in reverse vortex (\"tornado\"') flow. This reactor is universal in that it is capable of reforming both gaseous fuels and evaporated liquid fuels, such as diesel, gasoline, glycerol, etc. Gliding discharges are considered transitional discharges that combine non-equilibrium effects with relatively high power and controllable temperature to accelerate the partial oxidation chemical processes required for fuel conversion. Gliding discharge plasma is employed as a volumetric catalyst in the partial oxidation process to produce syngas (CO + H<sub>2<\/sub>) from hydrocarbons. Gliding discharge in tornado flow has several advantages including good mixing of fuel\/oxygen and greater uniformity of treatment as recirculation in the vessel allows all of the fuel to be treated in the plasma reaction zone. Plasma energy input in the total energy balance of the process is negligible (approximately 2%) in our experiments; however it is enough to realize a significant increase in process efficacy. New design features of this system include cylindrical internal reaction vessel walls made from metal that act as a secondary electrode and an internal liquid fuel evaporator driven by system exhaust heat. The new Tornado Fuel Conversion reactor is a robust and flexible system that can operate in a variety of temperature and pressure regimes and utilize many fuel sources.

In order to reduce the voltage spikes across the rectifier diodes caused by the leakage inductance in a high output voltage situation, 1\/2 level of the secondary rectified voltage appears first, and 1 level of that appears later.

However, current challenges for fuel cells such as high cost, sizing problem, and limited driving range, greatly affect the pace of FCV development. At the same time, domestic and renewable energy resource usage is frequently being encouraged for future electric propulsion applications. This philosophy has lead auto manufacturers to investigate the potential of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). In this paper, a fuel cell based PHEV (FC-PHEV) configuration, powered by combining an on-board regenerative fuel cell (RFC) and down-sized Ni-MH batteries, is modeled and investigated in detail. This configuration prospectively points towards remarkable advantages from the point of view of both environmental as well as cost friendliness. In addition, an FC-PHEV will also depict longer life span, while maintaining good vehicle performance, compared to regular plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs) or fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles (FC-HEVs). This paper will present a power train configuration of a FC-PHEV, developed for a family sedan. A suitable power management approach has been developed, which considers fuel economy, component efficiency, and driving pattern. The vehicle performance and feasibility are also investigated based on the modeling and simulation studies. A detailed comparison and discussion from the point of view of fuel economy, drive train efficiency, as well as practical cost and commercialization issues will also be presented.","arnumber":"4677706","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[A novel design and feasibility analysis of a fuel cell plug-in hybrid electric vehicle]]>","partnum":"4677706","pubtitle":"Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference, 2008.

First, the electric equivalent circuit model of the fuel cell and the supercapacitor is obtained using frequency analysis, which is essential in establishing a design procedure to size the required supercapacitor. It is evident from the nonlinear model of the supercapacitor that the capacitance increases with voltage. Since the fuel cell voltage is inversely proportional to the output power supplied, it is shown that combining fuel cell with supercapacitor is particularly advantageous to guard against load transients as higher energy is stored while supplying lighter loads. The other advantages of connecting the supercapacitor in parallel with the fuel cell are shown to be: (a) increased steady state stability when powering constant power loads, (b) voltage and system performance stability during fuel cell dynamics (purging), and (c) increased fuel efficiency (i.e. reduced hydrogen consumption). For transient stability analysis, the effect of fuel cell internal impedance (extra element), along with the impedance of the nonlinear supercapacitor, on the transfer function of the DC\/DC converter is analyzed. Finally, experimental evaluation and comparison of fuel consumption in the conventional and hybrid systems is performed, showing that the hybrid source has improved fuel utilization. From these results, it is shown that the proposed approach permits optimization of energy management and improvement of dynamic performance of the power conditioner. The experimental results obtained on 20 W and 30 W PEM fuel cell\/boost converter systems demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach.","arnumber":"4592311","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[The role of supercapacitors in designing fuel cell powered portable applications]]>","partnum":"4592311","pubtitle":"Power Electronics Specialists Conference, 2008.

These will be necessary to accommodate existing 14V loads as well as efficiently handle new heavy loads at the 42V net and an electrical traction drive on the HV bus. A low-cost bi-directional dc-dc converter was proposed in [10] for connecting the three voltage nets. The converter consists of two half-bridges and a high-frequency transformer; thus minimizing the number of switching devices and their associated gate driver components. One salient feature is that the half-bridge on the 42V bus is also utilized to provide the 14V bus by operating its duty ratio around an atypical value of 1\/3. This eliminates the need for an additional 14V\/42V converter. Moreover, it makes use of the parasitic capacitance of the switches and the transformer leakage inductance for soft-switching; no extra active switches or passive resonant components are required. The use of half-bridges makes the topology suitable for interleaved multi-phase configurations as a means to increase the power level because the capacitor legs can be shared. This paper presents simulation and experimental results on an interleaved two-phase arrangement rated at 4.5 kW. Also discussed are the benefits of operating with the atypical duty ratio on the transformer and a preferred multi-phase configuration to minimize capacitor ripple currents.","arnumber":"4195847","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[A Bidirectional, Triple-Voltage DC-DC Converter for Hybrid and Fuel Cell Vehicle Power Systems]]>","partnum":"4195847","pubtitle":"Applied Power Electronics Conference, APEC 2007 - Twenty Second Annual IEEE","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4195847","epage":"1049","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4195847&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"338","punumber":"4195690","publicationid":"4195847","doi":"10.1109\/APEX.2007.357644"}},{"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677730&contentType=Conference+Publications":{"author":[{"name":"F.

These low power fuel cells utilize graphite electrodes in anoxic sediment coupled to bottle brush graphite electrodes in the water column to make up a battery system. These battery systems typically produce power on the order of 10-50 milliwatts per square meter of electrode area, or as much as ten times more if sediment electrode pore water can be exchanged by means of a pump. As part of this program, testing of these microbial fuel cell batteries has been conducted in the Potomac River Washington D.C., Narragansett Bay Rhode Island, Tuckerton New Jersey, and Monterey Bay California. For these tests it has been necessary to develop long term, low power control and monitoring systems to manage the batteries operation and to record their performance without consuming a significant portion of the meager power produced. This paper details the development and testing of these low power monitoring systems and their results. For this project we have developed several related systems. All of the systems utilize Oopic microcontrollers as the core low power computer. The Oopic consumes about 20 mA at 5 volts when on and none when off. Its programs are stored on EEPROM, and they start from the beginning each time the Oopic is powered up. Notes from the previous time awake can be stored in the EEPROM below the program. The microcontrollers are turned on by an electronic alarm from an 12C real time alarm clock chip with its own multi year lithium battery. The microcontrollers command the shut off of power as part of their program. The real time clock maintains crystal controlled date and time without using any system power. The clock can be programmed to wake up the system at a specific date and time, or at any of numerous intervals. Once awake, the Oopic can check the date, - monitor\/control the system status and even operate a low power pump. Long term measurements over many months can be logged on a micro SD card by means of a serial file management storage chip which uses only 3 ma at 3.3 volts when not writing, and a momentary 40 mA to write. When the system is asleep none of the subsystems consumes any power. Programmed to awake once an hour for 20 seconds to monitor the system and record the results on the SD card, the average power consumption can be kept to less than 2 milliwatts. The control system can be woken up, report data, accept commands, or be reprogrammed; all through an RS232 serial cable. The system utilizes an RS232 chip that manufactures +\/-10 V RS232 signals from +5 V with only a few milliamps of additional power consumption. This chip is capable of communicating over a 100 m long cable at 9600 baud. In one instance in Tuckerton New Jersey near a dock, it was possible to continuously cable the control system ashore where a Netburner network based microcontroller was connected. The Netburner was programmed to provide an FTP and Telnet site, allowing remote monitoring and control from across the country over the internet.","arnumber":"5151990","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Low power control systems for microbial fuel cell batteries]]>","partnum":"5151990","pubtitle":"OCEANS 2008","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5151990","epage":"7","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5151990&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"340","punumber":"5089336","publicationid":"5151990","doi":"10.1109\/OCEANS.2008.5151990"}},{"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4160467&contentType=Conference+Publications":{"author":[{"name":"Xiaowei Liu","affiliations":"MEMS Center, Harbin Inst. of Technol.|c|"},{"name":"Bo Zhang","affiliations":""},{"name":"Yufeng Zhang","affiliations":""},{"name":"Xuebin Lu","affiliations":""},{"name":"Xilian Wang","affiliations":""},{"name":"Peng Zhang","affiliations":""}],"isbn":"1-4244-0610-2","py":"2007","spage":"905","abstract":"Based on CFD (computational fluid dynamics), modeling and numerical simulation of the muDMFC (micro direct methanol fuel cell) are carried out ,meanwhile the influence of the muDMFC with various flow channels design is studied using the CFDRC commercial code.

Such disadvantages become more severe in micro-scale DMFCs which require high conversion efficiency and small physical space to meet their strict working specifications. In this paper, a low power micro fuel supplier with programmable fuel concentration control was designed and fabricated using micro-fabrication (or MEMS) technology. The prototype adopted surface tension pumping as the primary driving force to transport fuel in the system without any extra power consumption. In addition, the well designed capillary network was used to ensure the precise fuel concentration regulation. At the same time, a thermal bubble-actuated pulse power switch was embedded in the capillary network and achieved the dynamic fuel concentration control for optimized DMFC operation. The advantages of high power density, precise fuel manipulation, low power fuel concentration control, and compact system size make the prototype a suitable fuel delivery subsystem for micro DMFC development.","arnumber":"4747016","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Low power fuel delivery with programmable concentration control for micro direct methanol fuel cells]]>","partnum":"4747016","pubtitle":"Sustainable Energy Technologies, 2008.

Unlike standard synchronous generators, fuel cells lack an inherent spinning reserve and their output power ramp rate is limited by the fuel cell design. Two strategies are herein investigated to mitigate the impact of a large load dynamic on the utility grid: (1) An external load-following strategy that adds ultra-capacitors through a DC-DC converter for electrical storage and (2) an internal strategy to decrease the steady-state utilization so more fuel is available during the output power dynamic. Both strategies successfully eliminate the impact of a load change on the utility grid. The ultra-capacitor strategy requires more capital investment while the utilization strategy necessitates lowered efficiency. This implies there is substantial flexibility when designing load-following fuel cell systems.","arnumber":"4402310","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Internal and External Strategies for Evolution of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells into Model Citizens of the Grid]]>","partnum":"4402310","pubtitle":"Power Symposium, 2007.

A higher working pressure around 2.5 bar is recommended, because it permits the PEMFC to have a higher efficiency, as well as a lighter stack and a lower volume than an equivalent PEMFC working at a lower pressure, moreover the water necessary for humidifying the membrane decreases, resulting in a simple management. For high pressure fuel cells, centrifugal compressors or positive displacement compressors with internal compression have to be preferred to those with external compression, because they offer a better efficiency. The built-in compression ratio has to be as close as possible to the fuel cell working pressure to ensure maximum efficiency.

It is shown, through experimental results, that the output voltage of NiCd powered systems is proportional to the duty cycle, for a given switching frequency. By contrast, DEFC systems do not exhibit predictable output as a function of duty cycle alone. Consequently, output voltage control through pulse width modulation (PWM) techniques applicable to NiCd systems cannot be employed for DEFC systems of similar power output.","arnumber":"4402292","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[An Evaluation of NiCd Battery and Direct Ethanol Fuel Cell DC Systems Output Characteristics]]>","partnum":"4402292","pubtitle":"Power Symposium, 2007.

Fuel cell energy generation system is one of the most exiting techniques that have many advantages such as being clean, reliable, oil independent, ozone friendly, vibration free, movable and having high efficiency. For ensuring fuel cells correct operation, it is surrounded by many ancillary circuits which consume about 40% of its energy product. About 30% of this consumed energy uses by compressor which provides required air of system. Because of that, it seems wise to control and optimize the performance of compressor to maximize the output energy of system. Generally, compressors do not have any analytical formula, so their performance models by some characteristic charts or empirical formulas. Therefore, in controlling compressors, using model-based controllers may causes error and not be useful. In this case, fuzzy logic controller which is more robust than other conventional controllers can be good candidate. In this study, three fuzzy logic controllers are designed for controlling compressor performance. Matlab\/Simulink toolbox is used to simulate system and study the accuracy and correctness of the system. The results show good accuracy of the designed controllers.","arnumber":"4757938","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Compressor\u2019s fuzzy logic controller design in proton membrane fuel cell generator]]>","partnum":"4757938","pubtitle":"Industrial Electronics, 2008.
