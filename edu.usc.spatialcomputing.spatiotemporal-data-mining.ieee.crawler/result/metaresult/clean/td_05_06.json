Therefore, fuel cells offer a potentially attractive back-up power solution for telecom sites where extended run times are desired, but generators are considered unacceptable. As customer expectations for a variety of uninterrupted communication technologies increase and\/or as the reliability of the electric grid decreases, these fuel-cell attributes will become increasing attractive. However, in order to be widely accepted for telecom-power applications, fuel cells must prove that they are more reliable and cost competitive than the incumbent solutions. This will require fuel-cell systems that are very simple, yet also very small, since added complexity and size results in inherently unreliable and expensive products. UTC Power has developed a back-up power product for telecom applications, which utilizes proprietary technology that requires minimal number of balance-of-plant components and has a polymer-electrolyte membrane fuel-cell (PEMFC) stack with unmatched power density.

It was a hydrogen fuel cell. However the possibility of using hydrocarbon fuels such as coal, wood, and other combustibles was being discussed within a few years. Since then interest in developing fuel cells has gone through several cycles. For example, there was a short period in the 1960's when large sums of money were spent on hydrocarbon fuel cells. However it was work on hydrogen fuel cells performed by F.T. Bacon in the United Kingdom from the 1930's to the 1960's that provided the incentive for US space program to begin using alkaline fuel cells made by General Electric in the Apollo space craft. That was followed by the use of General Electric polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells in Gemini space craft. In 1986 one of the developers at the Ballard organization (D.S. Watkins) in Canada found that an experimental membrane made by Dow Chemical caused the power from a PEM fuel cell to increase by a factor of four. That technological achievement was the beginning of a serious global interest in PEM fuel cells that has persisted for the past 20 years. In contrast, direct hydrocarbon fuel cells (DHFC) have received little attention. In this presentation, DHFC developments since the 1960's are described and an overview of the merits of DHFC technology is given. The emphasis is on improving energy efficiencies to decrease green house gas emissions.","arnumber":"4057356","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[The potential of direct hydrocarbon fuel cells for improving energy efficiency]]>","partnum":"4057356","pubtitle":"EIC Climate Change Technology, 2006 IEEE","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4057356","epage":"4","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4057356&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"5","punumber":"4057290","publicationid":"4057356","doi":"10.1109\/EICCCC.2006.277226"},{"isbn":"1-4244-0493-2","py":"2006","spage":"8 pp.","abstract":"The increasing penetration of variable speed wind turbines in the electricity grid results in a reduction of the number of connected conventional power plants.

Extended run backup power has been recognized as one of the early emerging PEM markets. The characteristics of PEM fuel cells offer an economical and efficient alternative to diesel generators and batteries, providing increased reliability and extend run capabilities. PEM fuel cells convert chemical energy from hydrogen and oxygen into electrical energy. As the hydrogen moves through a catalyst, called a cell, the protons and electrons are split and the electrons travel through a conductor. When the electrons return from the circuit and reconnect with the protons, they mix with oxygen, making the only by product of the electricity generating process, water and heat.

These components; provide, condition, and control, both hydrogen and air flow to the stack.

One consideration should be the range of load variation on the fuel-cell-system output. This is because of two reasons. The first reason is the current dependency of the fuel-cell output voltage; this can be overcome by utilizing a regulated power converter. The second reason is mechanical stresses resulting from continuous high current ripples that can reduce the system life span. Solving this problem requires appropriate filtering and converter controller. Selection of an ultra-capacitor and design of a proper controller require a fuel-cell-system model that can adequately represents the significant characteristics of the system. Such a model is developed in this paper via a simple method without requiring fuel cell design parameters.

Furthermore, a simple large-signal dynamic PEM fuel cell model is introduced of which the parameters can be found with an interrupted current method. This method estimates the parameters of the dynamic model. However, there was doubt whether the influence of small-signal disturbances in the fuel cell operation could be analyzed with the interrupted current method. Therefore, impedance spectroscopy measurements were performed on the fuel cell stack to determine if the large-scale model was applicable to small-signal excitations. Practical measurements show that an additional small-signal model should be introduced to characterize a fuel cell stack when switching ripple is present in the output current","arnumber":"1581849","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Dynamic Characteristics of PEM Fuel Cells]]>","partnum":"1581849","pubtitle":"Power Electronics Specialists Conference, 2005.

However, so far almost all DMFCs are fed with diluted methanol solution and supplied by the active pump attached in the DMFC system. This active component brings additional power consumption and extra physical space. It lowers the entire system efficiency. In this paper, a simple fuel delivery structure driven by surface tension is designed and assembled for the DMFC system. Due to the different surface tension of methanol and water, the methanol is expected to diffuse smoothly through the capillaries inside Teflon PTFE membrane into water side to form diluted fuel, whereas water is prevented from leaking to the methanol side. The experimental results demonstrated that the DMFC kit with the passive fuel delivery structure can achieve a largely extended operating time period compare to the one fed by diluted fuel. Meanwhile, the DMFC also exhibit higher fuel efficiency as power consumption is saved from active fuel delivery.

One of the main well-known problems of a fuel cell system is its slow dynamic response: the fuel cell system needs significant time to reach a new steady-state condition after a load change. Notice that fuel cell dynamics, in terms of time-constants, may be in the order of seconds while electrical loads are usually in the millisecond range. This slow dynamic response should be compensated to allow operation under quick load variation conditions. A separate energy storage device, such as a battery, can be used to supply power to the load during all transient periods in which the fuel cell is adapting its state according to the load request. This paper proposes a bi-directional converter to compensate for the fast load changes while the fuel cell system adjusts the fuel flow to deliver the necessary energy. Two control strategies are proposed: a current feed-forward control and a voltage feedback control. Simulink simulations have been developed to obtain insight about these control strategies, as well as about the behavior of the bi-directional converter. A 35 W hardware prototype has been built to verify the control performance. Experimental results of both controls are in agreement with their simulations and therefore validate the proposed control strategies. Both control strategies perform well. The current feed-forward control has the advantage of being extremely fast - with responses of the order of one time step of the digital controller - but has the disadvantage of requiring a load current sensor","arnumber":"1581845","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[An Active Filter for Fuel Cell Applications]]>","partnum":"1581845","pubtitle":"Power Electronics Specialists Conference, 2005.

The system can automatically adjust the fuel cell current to manage the battery state of charge, vary the battery current to regulate the bus voltage by delivering or adsorbing some amount of peak power, and, if necessary, trigger the supercapacitor to supply or accept excess peak power so as to limit the battery current. This concept is verified on by numerical simulation, and simulation results show that the proposed system can rapidly respond to the load power variations and adequately meet high peak power demand of the load.","arnumber":"1620699","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[A hybrid fuel cell power supply with rapid dynamic response and high peak-power capacity]]>","partnum":"1620699","pubtitle":"Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition, 2006.

What is needed is a zero-emission distribution generation technology or combination of technologies that allows clean, cost effective supply of energy, on demand on a large scale and in any location. In response a momentous energy revolution is taking place, renewable energy generation or decentralized power systems like wind, photovoltaic, as well as new hydrogen and fuel cells technologies are developing nowadays to take over from fossil hydrocarbons combustion. This paper proposes a model for the simulation and performance evaluation of a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell generation system. Although other models (Ro and Rahman, 1998) have been produced, the proposed model strength is modularizing the fundamental thermal-physical behaviour of a fuel cell stack to develop a modular block that can be used as a part of any other schematic solution required for fuel cells' study. The developed modular block (prototype) makes the model easy to modify to allow the simulation of any PEMFC with different cell parameters and allows investigation of its behaviour for any operating or design configuration. It is also useful for the study of integration of fuel cells in distribution power systems (which is promising especially to systems with variable output renewable sources as it can store their excess power thus improving the overall system stability). The proposed model exhibits most of the basic fuel cell properties and incorporates essential physical and electrochemical processes that happen along its operation, thus it can be moderated to model any other fuel cell' type. The proposed model prototype was verified and compared to another simplified model [2] by generating sample results for a Ballard V Proton Exchange Membrane Fu- - el Cell (PEMFC) stack. Results indicate that the developed prototype is more accurate in simulating the fuel cell stack and predicting its performance especially for high operating current densities.","arnumber":"4218660","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Investigation into Modelling of a Fuel Cell Stack System]]>","partnum":"4218660","pubtitle":"Universities Power Engineering Conference, 2006.

This is primarily because of increased publicity relating to acid rain, increased levels of air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuel depletion. One potential replacement for fossil fuel energy in internal combustion engines is fuel cells. Fuel cells, however, face a problem of declining power generation if contaminants are allowed to enter the fuel cell. The contaminants can enter the fuel cell as impurities in the fuel and oxidant gas streams. Additionally, fuel cell components such as bipolar plates and sealing gaskets have a tendency to evolve impurities which could degrade the performance of the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). This paper will explore the potential effects of contaminants on the performance of a PEMFC. The effect of low levels of carbon monoxide (CO) in the hydrogen (H2) fuel gas will be examined. Additionally, the ability of the fuel cell to recover from CO exposure will be explored. Preliminary guidelines for CO will be presented for hydrogen purity. The potential of metal contaminants to leach from the fuel cell components will also be explored.

Fuel cells for a residential application, with combined heat and power (CHP), may offer a viable energy source when both thermal and electrical outputs are associated with energy storage. The addition of grid connection improves reliability and offers the option to sell surplus energy when economically justified. A fuel cell has a variable, low voltage dc output requiring a power electronic interface to any energy storage and to ac loads. A simple inverter topology can be adopted based on minimum component count. This paper presents the design, simulation and experimental verification of an economic arrangement utilising an intermediate voltage storage battery and a bidirectional dc\/ac interface suitable for domestic ac loads and grid synchronisation. The design was modelled in Matlab\/Simulink.

Most likely wind turbines and fuel cells will be the dominant grid connected distributed generators. This paper proposes a novel integration of a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) and a fuel cell. With the proposed scheme, it is possible to inject power from a DC power source like a fuel cell into the AC grid without using an expensive inverter. The fuel cell is connected across the DC link of the back-back converters of a DFIG and power from the fuel cell is either injected into the generator or the grid depending upon wind conditions and energy requirements at the site. This is achieved by a low voltage DC link which also results in considerable savings. Dynamic models of DFIG and fuel cell have been derived which are used to simulate the proposed integrated system. Vector control schemes to operate the DFIG both as a power source and as an active filter compensating for harmful harmonics generated by non-linear loads are described. It has been shown that active and reactive power generated can be controlled. Power factor correction and reactive power control can also be achieved.

However, conventional fuel supply methods either with diluted methanol stored or driven by an attached active pump degrade their power density or efficiency dramatically. The active components also represent a considerable parasitic system loss adding complexity while consuming a significant part of power output which getting more severe in micro-scale DMFCs. In this paper, a passive fuel supply component with surface tension driving effect was designed and assembled in a laboratory-made DMFC prototype. The unidirectional methanol-to-water flow through Teflon PTFE membrane was achieved smoothly in its capillaries depending on their different surface tension. The prototype was demonstrated to last a largely extended operating time and exhibit higher fuel efficiency with pure methanol storage and passive fuel delivery compare to conventional DMFCs. The fluctuant output performance during its operation revealed that precise surface tension and geometry modification on further micro DMFC design is necessary. An improved model was then developed to facilitate instruction on such modification to achieve high cell performance.

But, the fuel cell has a slow dynamic response; therefore, an auxiliary power source is needed during start up and transient conditions. Batteries and ultracapacitors can be used as auxiliary power sources. Batteries have high energy density and ultracapacitors have high power density. By using both the battery and ultracapacitors as the auxiliary power sources of the FCEV, the performance and efficiency of the overall system can be improved. In this system, there is a boost converter, which steps up the fuel cell voltage, and two bi-directional DC-DC converters, that each of them couples the battery and ultracapacitors to the bus. Each bi-directional converter has two modes of operation. During the buck mode the battery\/ ultracapacitors will charge through the fuel cell or regenerative braking. During the boost mode they will supply the load. These converters should be properly controlled. Besides, a control strategy is needed to select the most suitable power source for supplying the load at each operating point, due to the efficiency of the system and demanding power. In this paper the fuzzy control method has been employed for controlling the whole system. Three kinds of fuzzy controllers are needed for this system. One of them is the main controller, which selects the switches that should be activated at each moment. The second one is the boost controller, which has 3 inputs and is needed for three switches.","arnumber":"4778597","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Fuzzy Control of a Hybrid Power Source for Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle using Regenerative Braking Ultracapacitor]]>","partnum":"4778597","pubtitle":"Power Electronics and Motion Control Conference, 2006.

We study here, the problem of coordinating the fuel and air flows into the fuel processor of a stationary PEMFC power plant based on the load requirement while ensuring proper regulation of the CPO (catalytic partial oxidation) reactor temperature and protecting the cell stack from hydrogen starvation. A linear model of the relevant dynamics is obtained from a nonlinear system level dynamic model. Model reduction is performed to obtain a linear model of tractable size. The open loop plant behavior is analyzed using relative gain array (RGA) and it is shown that loop interactions are significant away from DC.

Fuel cells normally generate direct current (DC) which must be converted into alternating current (AC) for transmission efficiency and for broader use by numerous loads of different characteristics. An AC load consists of real power and reactive power. The real power is generated by fuel cells. However, the reactive power must be created by other means. It is possible to create reactive power with DC\/AC inverters where the inverter feeds AC to inductors and capacitors. Usually inverters have very little overload capability (1-2X for about a second). On the other hand, if a synchronous condenser is installed on the AC bus, then the AC system needs to draw only the real power through the inverter. The reactive power is supplied by the synchronous condenser. The synchronous condenser could be designed to provide several times its nominal rating during transient or short period of time. Need for such overload is created when motors are started or when lines containing transformers are energized. A synchronous condenser could be the source of leading or lagging reactive power to meet needs of AC loads. A synchronous condenser is a rotating synchronous machine that has inertia and could store energy in its rotating mass. This inertia could be used to store or withdraw energy while fuel cells are reacting to rapid load changes. A fuel cell system together with synchronous condensers could be made to behave as an AC rotating generator with inertia and to supply real and reactive power.

A simple and economic control with DC-DC converter is used for maximum power point tracking and hence maximum power extraction from the wind turbine and photovoltaic array. Due to the intermittent nature of both the wind and photovoltaic energy sources, a fuel cell is added to the system for the purpose of ensuring continuous power flow. The fuel cell is thus controlled to provide the deficit power when the combined wind and photovoltaic sources cannot meet the net power demand. In worst environmental conditions, when there is no output power from the wind or photovoltaic sources, the fuel cell will operate at its rated power of 10 kW. Hence this system under any operating condition will ensure a minimum power flow of 10 kW to the load. This hybrid system allows maximum utilization of freely available renewable energy sources like wind and photovoltaic and demand-based utilization of hydrogen-based fuel cell. The proposed system is attractive owing to its simplicity, ease of control and low cost. Also it can be easily adjusted to accommodate different and any number of energy sources.

The hydrogen fuel can be placed directly into the tank onboard the hydrogen vehicle or it can be stored at the fueling station and used to fuel vehicles at a later time.

A DC-DC converter having a high turn ratio transformer is needed in such a system, to boost the low voltage of the fuel cell to a high level, to enable the DC-AC conversion and to provide isolation. The high turns ratio of the transformer causes a high leakage inductance, and therefore, reduces efficiency, and increases difficulty in control of the DC\/DC converter. In this paper a new DC-DC converter for fuel cell residential power generation systems is proposed. The proposed converter uses the leakage inductance for energy conversion, which not only reduces the problems of low efficiency and difficulty of control, caused by leakage inductance, but also eliminates the need for a separate inductor. Lack of a separate inductor helps reduce the cost of the DC\/DC converter. Also, soft switching is employed for some of the switches to reduce the switching losses. Consequently, the proposed DC-DC converter has low cost and high efficiency. Simulation and experimental results are presented to verify the proposed DC-DC converter.","arnumber":"1620662","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[A new DC-DC converter for fuel cell powered distributed residential power generation systems]]>","partnum":"1620662","pubtitle":"Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition, 2006.

The objective of this research is to identify technologies that could be employed to stabilize the grid by minimizing power fluctuations during peak load periods. In order to achieve this objective, distributed generating sources share the load during peak periods with the utility. These sources are called peak power shavers (PPS). The proposed system consists of a microturbine driving a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG). The AC power generated from the PMSG is rectified and, along with a fuel cell, is connected to the DC-link. A PWM inverter delivers AC power to the grid connected load. For large steady state power demand changes, controlling the fuel flow rate to the microturbine and\/or the hydrogen flow rate to the fuel cell can control the power flow from the PPS. For small load variations, changing the inverter modulation index can change the reactive power output while changing the phase angle of the output voltage can change the real power output","arnumber":"1709344","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Dynamic analysis of microturbine\/fuel cell for peak power shaving]]>","partnum":"1709344","pubtitle":"Power Engineering Society General Meeting, 2006.

In the feedback loop, it employs a PI controller which compensate the disturbance action caused by load change or islanding\/reconnection. The proposed controller reacts fast enough to the changes in load or grid connection states, and, as a result, it looks efficient in supplying to load the constant voltage without phase jump.

In this study we introduce a multi-objective compromise optimization to solve the optimal strategic plans of fuel cell industry, which is emerging industry in Taiwan. In the first step, we introduce popular analytic hierarchy process with fuzzy set theory to establish the hierarchy system to determine the relative importance of evaluated criteria. Secondly, fuzzy geometric mean method was utilized to aggregate the performance score by individual judgment of evaluator, which scores express the measurement of strategic plan proposed by participated experts. Thirdly, the synthetic value of each strategic plan was integrated by criteria weights with performance score, and positive ideal solution (PIS) and negative ideal solution (NIS) were defined by Minkowski's distance metric function. Fourthly, the optimal compromise solution will be derived which should have the shortest distance from the positive ideal solution as well as the farthest distance from the negative ideal solution.

FC technology presents one of the most promising solutions to reduce fossil fuel consumption. FC simulators are expected to play a key role in the development of FC systems due to their low cost and flexibility. This paper presents the development of a stand-alone FC simulator based on a low cost digital signal processor (DSP). The proposed fuel cell simulator emulates the electrical dynamic behavior of a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) stack. This is achieved via a power converter with a robust control strategy with fast dynamic response. The reference signal for the power converter that represents the dynamic behavior of the FC is generated from an experimental model of the DMFC that can be extended to other FCs. The output of the FC simulator is a reproduction of the dynamic behavior of DMFC model, thus emulating a FC stack. Test results of the FC simulator and the actual FC are compared and discussed. From the viewpoint of educational purposes, the proposed FC simulator provides a flexible solution at a low cost for student and engineers in training. In addition, the proposed simulator can be used for the design and development of FC power electronics","arnumber":"1557252","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Development of a fuel cell simulator based on an experimentally derived model]]>","partnum":"1557252","pubtitle":"Electrical and Computer Engineering, 2005.

The most common solution are large batteries, even though there are some inconveniences for the operator. Especially in northern regions, batteries can freeze during winter and suffer non-reparable damage. The exchange is strenuous at remote locations, due to the large weight and size of lead batteries. A more favourable and economic solution would be a fuel cell system, equipped for winter conditions, to supply the electrical energy. Another energy source that is often used, but not ideal, are photovoltaic modules (PV-modules). A common problem is that the PV-modules cannot cover the energy demand of the equipment during winter because the irradiation is very low. These facts suggest the development of a combination of PV-modules with fuel cells to get a more efficient, hybrid, energy supply. Existing energy supplies using PV-modules can be stocked up with a fuel cell easily, while new systems can be developed and laid out as hybrid systems. The object of this project is to develop a hybrid system consisting of a SFC A50 fuel cell and a PV-module. This hybrid system is meant to provide off-grid electrical equipment with a nominal power between 1 W and 20 W with energy. Numerous calculations were done using an idealized model, to optimise the system components for one specific application. The results have been verified in preliminary experiments. A demonstrator system consisting of a SFC A50, an Evergreen EC 110 PV-Module, a lead-acid battery and a charge regulator was built based on the optimisation. The components were assembled in a weather-proof cabinet. To improve the winter suitability of the SFC A50 system, a special insulation and a heat sink were added. The demonstrator was tested successfully over a time period of eight weeks, at temperatures between -35degC and 30degC. During this time, it was pos- sible to improve the demonstrator's reliability so far that the construction of further test systems was planned. Currently (winter 2004\/05), SFC has five systems running at different locations (e.g. Norway, Bavaria, Alps) afield","arnumber":"4134358","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Direct Methanol Fuel Cell Systems to supply small off-grid industrial equipment]]>","partnum":"4134358","pubtitle":"Telecommunications Conference, 2005.

Fuel cell powered e-vehicle has advantage in zero-emission, soundless driving, and quick fuel recharging time. However, it also has disadvantage in high manufacturing cost and durability issue. The development of fuel cell main component materials such as MEA, electrocatalyst and membrane has close relationship with the efficiency, durability and cost of fuel cell system. Recently, the concern about the durability of fuel cell system is focused because the lifetime is most important in market. The required lifetime of fuel cell in FCV is 5,000 hours and it is a tough target considering harsh driving condition and frequent start and stop of vehicle. The performance and durability of MEA is mainly dependent on the electrocatalyst and membrane. The degradation behavior of electrocatalyst and membrane are studied using various methods.

Smyrl et. al, AlChE J. 48, 1071) as well as for high-resolution voltammetric characterization (E.Yoon et. al, Jpn J. Appl. Phys. 39, 7159). Nitride-coated silicon wafers ([100] P-type) were photolithographically patterned with a series of windows ranging from 2 mum<sup>2<\/sup> to 800 mum<sup>2<\/sup> in size, and etched completely through using both wet and dry etching techniques. Using metal evaporation, one side of this porous silicon was patterned with a 1 nm thick Ti\/Au layer, providing conductive sites for microbial reduction that could be controlled for active surface area. Silicon-based anodes were tested as components in MEA-based fuel cells. Depending on the pattern of Au deposition and pore profile, anodes had characterized active surface areas ranging from a few square microns to- three orders of magnitude higher. Based on attachment and current production characteristics of G. metallireducens with these microfabricated anodes, designs were selected for refinement and miniaturization, with the goal of producing arrays of porous anodes, (approximately 0.25 cm<sup>2<\/sup>), for growth and testing of multiple electrode-reducing cultures, as well as flat anodes (on the order of 5 mum<sup>2<\/sup>) suitable for parallel, high-resolution electrochemical characterization of respiration at the microscale","arnumber":"4129430","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Microfabrication of anodes for use in microbial fuel cells]]>","partnum":"4129430","pubtitle":"Bio Micro and Nanosystems Conference, 2006.

However, easily implementing training algorithms such as back propagation through time and quasi-Newton algorithms require great amounts of memory and computational resources; moreover, those grow geometrically with the size of the time series (number of points in the sample used as training example). In the case of multiple output systems, the complexity of these algorithms grows also in a geometrical form, related to the number of system outputs and the number of hidden layers in the network, thus increasing the computation time to obtain a satisfactory solution. In this paper, some methodological and architectural solutions are proposed to overcome this drawback. The implementation simplicity of back propagation and quasi-Newton algorithms is nevertheless maintained, only their memory consumption and computation time is optimized to obtain a satisfactory dynamical model of a motor compressor group feeding a hydrogen fuel cell (in fact, a multiple input, multiple output system). To accomplish this goal, an artificial feedback loop is implemented and a parallel structure of one-output networks is selected as network architecture. The obtained results show that this architectural and methodological approach can be an interesting training option for complex multiple output system modelling using recurrent neural networks.","arnumber":"1554619","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Modelling of a motor compressor group feeding a hydrogen fuel cell using recurrent neural networks]]>","partnum":"1554619","pubtitle":"Vehicle Power and Propulsion, 2005 IEEE Conference","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1554619","epage":"","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1554619&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"290","punumber":"10416","publicationid":"1554619","doi":"10.1109\/VPPC.2005.1554619"},{"isbn":"1-4244-0759-1","py":"2006","spage":"78","abstract":"This article presents a brief method to solve a practical problem in today's fuel cell hybrid vehicle (FCHV) design, how to judge if a new fuel cell engine (FCE) can adapt to the rest parts of an existing power train system.

A novel two-phase approach to manage the daily operation of PEM fuel cells for residential applications is presented in this paper. Conventionally, the performance optimization is carried out offline since it is a time consuming process and needs high computational capabilities. To simplify the management process and to enable online parameter updating, the paper suggests a new technique using artificial neural network (ANN). Firstly, a database is extracted by performing offline optimization processes at different load demands and natural gas and electricity tariffs using a genetic algorithm (GA). Then, the obtained results are used for the offline training and testing of the ANN, which can be used on-site to define the settings of the fuel cell. The tariffs and load demands as inputs of the ANN can be easily updated online to enable the ANN to estimate new optimal or quasi-optimal set points after each variation in operating points. The agreement between ANN decisions and optimal values as well as the achieved reduction in operating costs encourage the implementation of the proposed technique to achieve both fast online adaptation of settings and near optimal operating cost. This technique is applicable for different distributed generating units (DGUs), which are expected to spread within the power systems in the near future.","arnumber":"1489132","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Online optimal management of PEM fuel cells using neural networks]]>","partnum":"1489132","pubtitle":"Power Engineering Society General Meeting, 2005.

A simple optimization method is given to maximize the voltage gain including the voltage drop due to the compression process. The optimization has to take into account the outlet relative air humidity (optimization constraint) leaving the fuel cell to avoid drying or flooding problems. The optimization results show that working at fully humidified air at the inlet is not always a good solution especially for low air mass flow rates because of the high level of air stoichiometry to avoid flooding of the polymer membrane. On the other hand, it is better to work at fully humidified air at the inlet at high air mass flow rates.

Preservation at ambient temperatures would eliminate the need for cryogenic equipment and the associated costs. Preservation of Geobacter Sulfurreducens (the bacterial fuel cell) at ambient temperatures would be particularly useful given its potential applications in technology. This has led to preliminary experiments for the preservation of the Geobacter Sulfurreducens in carbohydrate-based glasses using inositol, trehalose and sucrose. Geobacter was suspended in various carbohydrate solutions prepared from a stock solution of 4% D <sub>2<\/sub>O in PBS and deposited on CaF<sub>2<\/sub> slides in the form of small (400nl) droplets and dried isothermally at ambient temperatures. FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy) analysis of droplets containing the carbohydrate solutions and the Geobacter were performed to determine the desiccation characteristics of the carbohydrate solutions, their coating efficiency and the desiccation induced damage in Geobacter as a function of desiccation conditions. D <sub>2<\/sub>O in the experimental solutions provided a unique peak around 2500 cm<sup>-1<\/sup> in the IR spectra, which is used to quantify the water content of the sample. Optical analysis of the desiccated solutions showed heterogeneous conditions within the drying droplets. Comparison of the IR spectra at the center and the periphery of the droplets showed significant differences. This is thought to be a result of the bacteria clumping in the center regions and rejecting the solutes in the carbohydrate solution toward the circumference of the droplet. It was also observed that the peak magnitudes of the trehalose, sucrose and inositol were comparatively larger as compared to the amide-I peak (showing the bacteria concentration) at the circumference than at the center. This is in agreement with the optical observat- - ions showing glassy areas forming at the circumference during drying for the solutions containing sucrose and trehalose. These initial experiments demonstrated the heterogeneities occuring in sessile droplets during desiccation. Research is under way to develop methods that will enable homogeneous desiccation and vitrification of the biopreservation solutions coating the Geobacter.

A failure in the fuel system that impacts the ability to deliver fuel to the engine will have an immediate effect on system performance and safety.

Current diagnostic techniques call for careful maintenance of fuel system components. These techniques tend to be backward thinking in that they are based on previous experience which is not always a good indicator for future systems. This paper describes a technique developed at the Penn State Applied Research Laboratories Condition Based Maintenance Department for fault detection and reconfiguration for fuel delivery system components.

Large number of experiments is usually required in order to establish how stem cells can be effectively grown outside the body before they can be effectively used in regenerative medicine to cure life-style related diseases. These can range from the determination of the optimum growth factors to the cell differentiation mechanism. Such experiments if they were to be truly exhaustive are not only costly in terms of the scientist's effort but require large sterilised incubation space, particularly if they were to be carried out manually using Petri dishes based on 10 reagents - requiring a combination of 10! In order to comprehensively explore all the possible combination of the reagent and growth factors required, high throughput automated dispensing and high density micro-wells are critically required. The viability of the cells for large scale experiments depends on many factors. The main aim of the research describe in this paper is to establish the key factors to ensure cell viability. This include the determination of most effective number of wells per plate; its ideal size, diameter and depth; amount of fluid to contain; effective number of cells in a colony; level of humidity; salinity and evaporation rates of the medium.

In this work, a very thin polyimide film LaRCtrade-CP1 was used as substrate or superstrate for amorphous silicon solar cell fabrication.

Meanwhile, the consumption of fossil fuel in the transport field is one of the major sources of local environmental pollution and global greenhouse gas. Therefore, it is imperative that the change of the current transport energy be carried out. In order to promote energy safety, environmental protection and sustainable development of the automobile industry, in 2001 the Chinese government, through rigid planning and rigorous argumentation, launched the Special Research Program on the Development of Electric Vehicles.","arnumber":"4233979","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[The Development of Fuel Cell Vehicles in China]]>","partnum":"4233979","pubtitle":"Vehicular Electronics and Safety, 2006.

An experimental apparatus was designed to generate, in laboratory conditions, laminar, axisymmetric, time- varying and non-premixed flames of these fuels. Characterization of temperature in such flame was managed. The experimental data were used for the testing of a very simple formulation for fuel oxidation. To proceed, the gases released from the pyrolysis of one of the above vegetative fuels were analysed by means of a tube furnace apparatus connected to a gas chromatograph. Using numerical methods the transient equations for the conservation of mass, momentum, energy and chemical species were solved for the flame as well as the radiative transfer equation. The calculated distribution of temperature is presented for this fuel. It does agree with the experimental data recorded as a function of time, at different heights in the flame.","arnumber":"4150424","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Computational and experimental study of laminar flames from forest fuels]]>","partnum":"4150424","pubtitle":"Environment Identities and Mediterranean Area, 2006.

Two very significant alternatives were rejected or neglected. The first alternative was sea based semi submerged nuclear power plant ships deployed in a line paralleling the coastline of the United States. The US has developed and deployed hundreds of nuclear powered submarines without an accident affecting the people or the environment. The US has also built and successfully operated a number of land based pressurized water reactors at the 3,000 megawatt level. The marriage of these two developments would have a very significant effect on the electrical energy production now produced by fossil fuels. The second development is based on the recognition that the transport and use of hydrogen requires its containment in molecules for which nitrogen is the container. Practically this limits transport in the form of hydrazine and\/or ammonia. Ammonia has been successfully used by nations deprived of a source of fossil fuel. If ammonia can be created without the use of hydrocarbons, then an ammonia energy economy is possible. The late William H. Avery has already demonstrated that large (1-3 thousand megawatt) OTEC plants located in the doldrums inside exclusive economic zones can generate tanker transported ammonia without the use of fossil fuels at a cost which is increasingly competitive with fossil fuels. The nations which implement one or both of these alternatives may be the only nations to achieve energy independence in the 21st century","arnumber":"1640032","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Realistic ocean energy alternatives to fossil fuels]]>","partnum":"1640032","pubtitle":"OCEANS, 2005.

A signature degradation trace of the on-voltage of IGBT modules was observed from accelerated power cycling test. This on-voltage \"anomaly\" can be attributed to sequential events of solder joint degradation followed by wirebond lift-off mechanisms.

Each sensor geometry and construction can give rise to different behaviors under temperature gradients, limiting the possible accuracy in density measurements. In this work, an ultrasonic density measurement cell is experimentally characterized and its performance in the presence of temperature gradients is studied in the 15 to 40degC temperature range for several liquids. The propagation velocity can be measured with high accuracy (0.07 %) in a range of temperatures as long as the sample chamber length is corrected.

The ITRS roadmap envisages that high performance CMOS circuits will require ultra-low gate oxide thickness to overcome the effects of shorter channel lengths. However, such devices will be susceptible to a more profound leakage mechanism due to carrier tunneling through the gate oxide. Consequently, the gate oxide tunneling current has emerged as the major component of the leakage power consumption of nanoscale CMOS devices. In the case of an important CMOS circuit like Static RAM (SRAM) there is a high probability for the leakage currents to be manifested with more prominence. SRAMs form a vital component of the CPU cache therefore there is a critical need for analysis, explanation, and characterization of the various tunneling mechanisms SRAMs. This paper explores the gate leakage current scenarios in the READ, WRITE and IDLE states of the SRAM which can make significant contribution to modeling and reduction of gate leakage in SRAM circuits.","arnumber":"5507432","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Gate leakage current analysis in READ\/WRITE\/ IDLE states of a SRAM cell]]>","partnum":"5507432","pubtitle":"Region 5 Conference, 2006 IEEE","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5507432","epage":"200","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5507432&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"374","punumber":"5496819","publicationid":"5507432","doi":"10.1109\/TPSD.2006.5507432"},{"isbn":"1-4244-0485-1","py":"2006","spage":"233","abstract":"One of the key issue in microfinance is credit risk assessment.

It also indicated that replacing this gasoline energy would require 200-250 GW (Gigawatts) of additional electrical generating capacity. (Uhrig, 2005) In an earlier article, the author showed that about 930 GW of additional electrical generating capacity would be required to produce hydrogen by electrolysis to replace all the gasoline used for all transportation in the United States.

Should either of these substitutions be even partially implemented, the choice of fuel for the new generation of electricity and the method of producing hydrogen could either significantly increase or decrease future greenhouse gas emissions. The purpose of this paper is to provide quantitative comparisons of greenhouse gas emissions, specifically carbon dioxide, between all of the various options. The results indicate that greenhouse gas emissions are small or negligible when electricity generated by solar, renewables, or nuclear energy are used either directly or to produce hydrogen. However, when fossil fuels (natural gas, oil, or coal) were used, the greenhouse gas emissions were greater than for gasoline fueled vehicles in most cases.

Small dimensions, small power, and the neighbourhood of generators and consumers characterize these systems. Decentralized generation in the power system is studied not only in direct connection with the high voltage transmission grid, but also as islanded network with distributed generation on various levels of the power system itself. In the first case, the generating units could be disconnected from the system during disturbances. In the second case the generation units have to remain connected, because they participated at the stability of the network. Therefore appropriate control schemes are required. The paper presents the simulation of a LES, modelled as a meshed medium voltage network with lumped loads, connected to the conventional high voltage network and supplied from local generation units as well. Control schemes and protection of the decentralized generators are implemented and tested.

As part of the feasibility and conceptual-design analysis, we have analyzed the potential benefits of a hybrid powerplant in which fuelcells comprise the prime mover and a battery or flywheel comprises the rechargeable auxiliary power device. Potential benefits of a hybrid powerplant are (1) enhancement of transient power and hence tractive effort, (2) regenerative braking, and (3) reduction of capital or recurring costs. Generally, tractive effort of a locomotive at low speed is limited by wheel adhesion and not by available power. Enhanced transient power is therefore unlikely to benefit a switcher locomotive but could benefit applications, such as subway trains with all axles powered, requiring high acceleration. In most cases, the benefits of regenerative braking in locomotives are limited. For low-speed applications such as switchers, both the available kinetic energy and the effectiveness of DC traction motors as generators are low. For high-speed heavy applications such as freight, the ability of the auxiliary power device to absorb a significant portion of the available kinetic energy is low. Moreover, the hybrid powerplant suffers a double efficiency penalty: losses occur in both absorbing and then releasing energy from the auxiliary device, result in a net storage efficiency of no more than 50% for current battery technology. Where the duty cycle peak power demand requires that a significant portion of the prime mover energy is cycled into auxiliary power device then a net increase in fuel consumption can result. Capital cost in some applications may be reduced. Based on recorded locomotive duty cycles and a cost model utilized in this project, hybridity can reduce fuelcell capital cost. However, because of the double efficiency penalty and increased powerp- - lant complexity, we predict it will increase recurring costs such as fuel and maintenance. In particular, the choice of the optimum capital cost solution would increase the fuel consumption by as much as 20-40%. Moreover, for usual rail duty cycles, the weight and volume of the combined powerplant would be significantly increased. Based on this analysis, the consortium has decided to develop for this project a pure fuelcell road-switcher locomotive, that is, not a hybrid locomotive","arnumber":"1634085","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Fuelcell hybrid locomotives: applications and benefits]]>","partnum":"1634085","pubtitle":"Rail Conference, 2006.

An efficient transmission system always leads to better fuel economy. As we know, parallel hybrid vehicles use electric as well as fuel power simultaneously to drive the vehicle. For specific power developed, since (Power) = (Torque)middot(Speed), for a specific speed, optimum torque will be well defined. If we use conventional gearbox in the transmission train, we get stepped speeds. It is not possible to tap any intermediate speed from conventional drive. Concept of 'Proportional Loss of Speed' says that if we want a specific speed, which is not available in the conventional gear train for a particular instant, the higher or lower speed chosen, causes loss of power. Since electrical as well as mechanical efficiencies are both defining the total efficiency of the drive, it is not desirable to allow loss of power at any instant. That means we must use such a drive in which any particular speed in the given range can be tapped. This is possible using continuously variable transmission (CVT). This paper will discuss mechanical transmission system design and CVT control philosophy to optimize energy efficiency of the system.","arnumber":"4156556","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Mechanical Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) for Parallel Hybrid vehicle]]>","partnum":"4156556","pubtitle":"Electric and Hybrid Vehicles, 2006.

The new technology of battery operated electric vehicles is likely to replace conventional IC engine automobile technology soon. Pune is a major automobile hub of India. Tata Motors, Bajaj Auto, Kinetic engineering etc. have their automobile manufacturing units at Pune. Many automobile manufacturing units are situated at Nashik and Mumbai. Apart from these units, some small and medium size industrial units such as Gulane Engineering, Martin Frank (Motion Control) Pvt. Limited and Technovision have already started development of various components for battery operated electric vehicles. However there are some common issues related to electric vehicle technology. These include selection of batteries, selection of electric motors for specific capacity vehicles, design of controllers, design of battery chargers with specific applications to electric vehicles, development of testing facility for testing of electric motors, controllers and battery chargers. In this situation the industry-institute interaction will play a key role and part of R&amp;D and testing activities can get diverted to educational institution with adequate infrastructure. This paper emphasizes basic details regarding characteristics of various motors and controllers used for battery operated electric vehicles. Comparative study of various motors used for electric vehicle applications is presented. The role of local transport authorities in promoting electric vehicles for cities like Pune is also presented.","arnumber":"4156560","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[A Scope for the Research and Development Activities on Electric Vehicle Technology in Pune City]]>","partnum":"4156560","pubtitle":"Electric and Hybrid Vehicles, 2006.

The acceptance is growing both in the awareness of industries as well as of consumers. Therefore many industries and service providers are diversifying into reusable and recyclable products. One possible option to show products' environmental performance is to label the products with a son of eco-labels. Also politic is promoting the protection of environment, at least to lower the amount of waste, thus certain legislations and directives are enacted e.g. ELV, WEEE, RoHS, Packaging Directive etc. However, the compliance with most of today's directives does not lead directly or as a matter of course to more environmentally friendly products or systems. On the contrary, the constrain to comply with these directives could lead to raise the \"overall\" environmental burdens caused by considered products or systems, since the directives often only cover the End of Lifes but not other life cycle stages (production and use phase).

Because of our abundant energy resources and leadership in hydrogen technologies, Canada is well positioned to lead in the transition to a hydrogen economy.

In particular, the performance of a power system with significant penetration of distributed resources is described to assess different types of stability of the bulk network. For this purpose, a hypothetical network is simulated, assuming a large number of fuel cells and micro-turbines as dispersed units in the low-voltage area. The investigation is carried out at constant load demands but with different contributions from fuel cells and micro-turbines. Thus, the rated and supplied powers of the conventional synchronous generators are adjusted to achieve the power balance in the network. With each penetration level of the distributed generation, the performance of the network is studied and different stability classes are analysed. The results are compared with the performance of the network without any distributed generation, as a reference case, to highlight the influence of penetration levels of such units on the stability of the entire network.","arnumber":"1489354","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Impact of distributed generation on the stability of electrical power system]]>","partnum":"1489354","pubtitle":"Power Engineering Society General Meeting, 2005.

With the exhaustion of fossil resources the energy economy will change from a chemical to an electrical base. This transition is one of physics, not one of politics. However, proven technology and existing engineering experience come in useful. Actions must be taken soon to start a transition process which will take many years to complete. Unfortunately, politics seems to listen to the advice of visionaries, lobby groups and environmental activists, all presenting qualitative arguments, hardly ever based on facts and physics. A secure sustainable energy future cannot be founded on shaky arguments, hype and activism, but has to be built on solid grounds of established science and engineering. This article is in part a response to false claims of hydrogen promoters. Although most qualitative claims are correct, in total they do not properly consider some fundamental laws of physics, in particular, the energy conservation principle. Hydrogen is not a new energy, but only an artificial synthetic energy carrier. It has to be made from high grade energy like electricity or natural gas. Before the technology of a hydrogen economy is developed or implemented, some fundamental question needs to be addressed. Where does the energy come from to be delivered to the consumer in the form of hydrogen? How much energy is lost in the hydrogen distribution system? Are there other ways to bring the energy to the people? How much of the original energy is needed to satisfy the energy needs of society? These questions have been studied in detail. This publication builds on the results of this energy analysis of a hydrogen economy. It translates the results into a wider perspective and draws conclusions that are devastating for a hydrogen economy.

We focused on improving the performance of the vehicle during the first gallon of gas consumption by adding or swapping components such as batteries, battery chargers, fuel cells, and efficient engines, electrical motors and generators. The improved performance was accomplished by charging the batteries overnight and operating the vehicle in a purely electric-vehicle mode before the engine started.

However, because of the non-dispatchable nature of renewable energy and slow nature of some alternative energy power generation sources, e.g. fuel cells, multi-source operation of these sources and\/or their parallel operation with a storage device is necessary to make their operation more reliable. This paper discusses the need for multi-source operation of AEDGs. It reviews four different AEDG sources - wind, solar photovoltaic (PV), microturbine, and fuel cells - and discusses their multi- source operation for better power management and reliability.","arnumber":"4201368","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Alternative Energy Distributed Generation: Need for Multi-Source Operation]]>","partnum":"4201368","pubtitle":"Power Symposium, 2006.

A typical IGCC plant consists of the air separation unit, gasification system, gas cleanup processes, gas and steam turbine combined cycle. Modeling and control of multiple ICCC components and technology integration play a leading role. In this article, some practical control approaches for individual components of the ICCC plants are explored, such as air blown control and oxygen blown control under conditions of startup, loading, steady state, unloading and shutdown operations throughout the compressor trip, gasifier trip, gas turbine trip and steam turbine trip.

In order to utilize the current infrastructure of the grid for power transmission and distribution, grid-connected dc-to-ac inverters are needed. However, previously proposed voltage source inverters with a two-power-stage structure or a cascaded structure increase the power losses and the complexity of the circuit. The current source type inverter with a large dc side inductor is also not desirable due to its size, weight and losses. A new three-phase boost-type grid-connected inverter, which can be controlled by one-cycle control (OCC) method or the conventional pulse width modulation (PWM) method, is proposed in this paper. The proposed inverter has only a single power stage converting dc power to ac power by injecting three sinusoidal currents into grids, which greatly reduces power losses and the complexity of the circuit. The input dc voltage is lower than the peak grid voltage and can vary in a wide range, which interfaces well with the dc voltage of the photovoltaic or fuel cells. The large dc side inductor is not necessary and the output ac currents are sinusoidal and in phase with grid voltages. With OCC method, the inverter preserves the advantages of simple circuitry, good stability and fast dynamic response. Experiments have been performed with a 1.5kW laboratory prototype to verify the good performance of the inverter.","arnumber":"1620629","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Three-phase boost-type grid-connected inverters]]>","partnum":"1620629","pubtitle":"Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition, 2006.

Quite a few studies have examined individual clusters with the purpose of identifying their essential components and of determining the conditions in which they may arise and prosper. In most of the literature however, it is recognized that there is little firm knowledge about their development process, and about the ways in which they can be promoted and fostered. The \"path specificity\" of their developments seems to hinder attempts at identifying specific measures that can promote their appearance and growth in contexts different from those where they already have. Canada's effort in this endeavour, however, seems to be paying off, since the country can boast of several burgeoning innovation clusters, some of which seem to be responding to specific policy measures at the regional level. In this study we have aimed at elucidating the structure and dynamics of two innovation clusters in British Columbia: the biotechnology innovation cluster, and the fuel cell innovation cluster, in order to gain a better understanding of their structure, their dynamics, and the way in which they respond to specific efforts by their actors and promoters","arnumber":"4077378","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Regional Systems of Innovation in Canada: Two Case Studies]]>","partnum":"4077378","pubtitle":"Technology Management for the Global Future, 2006.

In this article, the case is made for an exergy-based method for allocating emissions for cogeneration systems. In the part I of this two-part article, comparisons are made of methods for allocating carbon dioxide emissions from cogeneration. Here, in part II of the article, the author demonstrates that exergy methods can form the basis of sound and meaningful allocation methods for carbon dioxide emissions, and that there are problems associated with the other methods. In addition, the results indicate that the exergy-based emissions allocations method provides a sensible foundation for a meaningful overall approach to emissions trading.

It conquered the usual disadvantage of high voltage needed to drive PZT actuator. It is capable of pumping both the liquid and air gas with the unique check valve design within the micro-fluidic channel and the pump material is made of EPDM to stand with the erosion of liquid methanol as fuel of DMFC device. It also consists the character of small size for the micro-pump after packaging process. Spec of the micro-pump developed by this project is 3 c.c.\/min of pumping flow rate or 150 mm-H2O for pumping pressure head at the condition of plusmn24 volts and 20 Hz for driving voltage and frequency, respectively, and power consumption is only about 40 mW. Since the micro-pump driven by a PZT actuator, the power consumption and heat generation by the micro-pump are negligible. Also, with the piezoelectric actuation being instantaneous, there is no delay in generating mechanical motion of the diaphragm from a given electrical input.

A responsible answer and approach is available using Canadian CANDUtrade (Canadian Deuterium Uranium) nuclear energy technology, which meets the goals of safe, affordable, reliable energy, whilst contributing to a sustainable energy future for Canada and the world. The answers to the issues usually raised with nuclear energy are proven: (1) The cost of nuclear energy is cheaper than the alternatives; (2) Nuclear plants are built to schedule, and operate efficiently and well; (3) Environmental impacts are minimal; (4) High standards for safety have been established worldwide; (5) Spent fuel storage is no longer a technical matter, but a policy decision; (6) Proliferation and terrorism have never arisen from commercial nuclear power; (7) Stability of energy price and supply are ensured and demonstrated; (8) The use of nuclear energy can and will enable the Hydrogen Economy; (9) Investments in nuclear energy make a competitive return; (10) In Canada, a unique potential synergism exists with hydro, wind and oil sand sources; (11) Development of new concepts and designs are underway internationally; (12) Future emissions reduction strategies can and should explicitly allow the nuclear contribution. Given the gravity of the global threats, we must use all possible avenues of CO<sub>2<\/sub>\/GHG abatement and sources of energy, with an urgency exacerbated by the over-dependence of the world on expensive and volatile oil and gas supplies. Emissions reductions promised under the Kyoto Treaty are far too little and too unlikely, and the Treaty leaves nuclear fission effectively and artificially beyond effective political consideration in many established and wealthy countries.

Hence a power electronic inverter is required to condition this output into a more conventional constant magnitude AC supply voltage. Such an inverter should be light weight, low cost, efficient, and provide galvanic isolation between the source and the AC output\/grid connection. It is also often preferable that the inverter draws constant DC current from the input energy source, which means it must smooth out the double-fundamental-frequency energy flow of a single phase AC load connection. These requirements can be met with a double conversion system incorporating a high frequency DC-DC step up converter to produce a relatively constant high voltage DC output from the varying DC input, and a high voltage DC-AC inverter and filter to produce the final AC output. This paper describes the winning entry inverter developed by the Monash University FEC undergraduate team for the 2005 IEEE Future Energy Challenge to meet these requirements.

Conventional methods using cascade DC\/DC converters cause extra complexity and higher cost. The conventional topologies to get high output voltage use flyback DC\/DC converters.

The use of alternative energy sources such as water turbines, solar cells and wind turbines becomes essential for producing clean energy. In this paper, a novel design of a 1 kW DC\/AC inverter is presented. The inverter is versatile, allowing for the connection of any DC alternative power source such as solar cells, wind turbines, etc, to the AC grid. Therefore, in peak load times, every household can perform as a clean micro power station. The inverter is implemented as a phase shift synchronous generator and it is controlled by means of a DSP. Sampling the grid voltage makes it possible for the inverter to synchronize with the grid at a zero angle. Then the DSP synthesizes the AC voltage waveform to be shifted, with respect to the grid, with a software controllable leading angle. This configuration makes it possible to transfer the clean energy omitted by the alternative power source to the grid. Energy contribution to the grid is possible by connecting synchronous generators that have 80% efficiency.

Dissimilatory metal reducing bacteria, including Shewanella oneidensis and Geobacter sulfurreducens, produce electrically conductive nanowires in direct response to electron acceptor limitation and facilitate electron transfer to solid phase iron oxides. Nanowires produced by S. oneidensis strain MR-1, which served as our primary model organism, are functionalized by decaheme cytochromes MtrC and OmcA that are distributed along the length of the nanowires. Mutants deficient in MtrC and OmcA produce nanowires that were poorly conductive.

A DC\/DC converter stage increasing the voltage level is connected to a DC\/AC inverter for grid current injection via a high capacitance DC link. This decouples the momentary power drawn from the energy source from the momentary power being injected into the grid, allowing arbitrary output current waveforms without an increase of input current ripple. Conventionally, pure fundamental frequency currents are considered the optimum waveform regarding the injected currents impact on the grid. This paper demonstrates how grid voltage harmonics caused by nonlinear loads can be minimized by adapting the converters injected current shape. In contrast to harmonics compensation in industrial applications where the compensation current is determined by measuring the local loads current harmonics, the intended decentral application in private houses suggests a different approach to improve overall grid voltage quality. The digital signal processor used for the converters control and monitoring functions calculates the frequency spectrum of the measured grid voltage run by digital Fourier transformation (DFT) and determines the current harmonics necessary to counteract the present voltage harmonics. The resulting current frequency spectrum is modulated into a time dependant current shape that is added to the fundamental frequency current run determined by the requested amounts of active and reactive power. This way, harmonic currents of the local loads are compensated without changes in the house installation for measuring the loads currents. Also current harmonics of neighbouring houses are compensated.","arnumber":"1569304","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Improving grid voltage quality by decentral injection of current harmonics]]>","partnum":"1569304","pubtitle":"Industrial Electronics Society, 2005.

The battery side voltage ranges from 11 V to 16 V while the fuel cell is operated between 220 V and 447 V and the required power is typically 1 kW. Careful analysis shows that the high currents on the battery side cause significant design issues in order to obtain a high efficiency. The standard phase shift modulation method can result in high conduction and switching losses.

The grid integration of intermitting renewable energy sources is not only an issue of distribution networks, but effects the transmission grids as well. The largest amount of new installations are connected to the transmission grid, especially into 110-kV. Further, large wind farms with some 100 MW have already been connected to the 400-kV-system. The renewable energy sources are connected to the power network via power electronic converters, and this type of connection schema can change the short circuit conditions in the network. Today, usually a tripping command is generated within the first period, but in the future contributions to the short circuit current by renewable sources are necessary to fulfil the selective clearing of faults. To investigate the new requirements some novel simulation models are necessary, and described in the paper, for: converter connected DC sources (fuel cell, PV plants), doubly fed induction generator, DFIG, converter connected synchronous generator. Using these models the simulation allows for investigating the behavior for various control design.

In this paper, a scheme is proposed that allows the use of a single DC source as the first DC source with the remaining n - 1 DC sources being capacitors. It is shown that a simple 7-level equal step output voltage switching control can simultaneously maintain the balance of DC voltage levels of the capacitors, eliminate specified low order non-triplen harmonics, and produce a nearly sinusoidal three-phase output voltage. This scheme therefore provides the capability to produce higher voltages at higher speeds (where they are needed) with a low switching frequency method for motor drive application, which has inherent low switching losses and high conversion efficiency.

Due to their high power densities (&gt;10s kW\/cm<sup>-3<\/sup>) MDs provide an intense source of electron impact dissociation as well as high gas temperatures (&gt;1000 K) for thermal dissociation. By operating at pressures up to and including atmospheric, reformation of N<sub>2<\/sub> and H<sub>2<\/sub> from the dissociation products by three body reactions can be efficient. In this paper, results from a computational investigation of production of H<sub>2<\/sub> from atmospheric pressure microdischarges in Ar\/NH<sub>3<\/sub> mixtures will be discussed. The computational platform is a 2-dimensional plasma hydrodynamics model having an unstructured mesh to resolve non-equilibrium electron, ion and neutral transport using fluid equations. Sheath accelerated, beam-like electrons are resolved using a Monte Carlo simulation. A compressible Navier-Stokes module provides the bulk fluid velocities and temperatures. The devices we investigated are cylindrically symmetric sandwich type reactors with characteristic dimensions of 100s mum at high pressures (few 100s torr to atmospheric). Results from a parametric investigation of power (up to 10s W), flow rates (residence time of a few mus) and Ar\/NH<sub>3<\/sub> ratios will be discussed with the goal of maximizing the conversion of NH<sub>3<\/sub> to H<sub>2<\/sub> while minimizing the required power","arnumber":"1707265","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Hydrogen production in Ar\/NH\/sub 3\/ micro-discharges]]>","partnum":"1707265","pubtitle":"Plasma Science, 2006.

Decisions made by supplier (price of electricity to\/from households) influence decisions of households (1. micro-CHP power level and 2. amount of discharged heat) and determine the supplier's operational costs. When the supplier takes into account the cost optimization of households (that is based on the supplier's decision) in making his price-setting decisions, the problem can be described as a multi-level decision-making (MLDM) problem. We describe how the problem can be modelled and present a solution strategy which considers a combination of two objective functions that are subject to a set of constraints.

For this, a high voltage cascade inverter with step pulse PWM strategy is an applicable topology as it can reduce electromagnetic interference as well as switching losses on power devices. The converter is usually controlled with a look-up table of commutation angles, which are computed off-line base on an assumption of equal dc voltage sources. However, in reality, the inequality of these dc voltage sources can occur due to different charging\/discharging processes and this reduces the quality of output voltages such as the existence of low order harmonics and an error in fundamental voltage. To overcome this problem, PWM angles in the look-up table can be changed according to different cases of dc source variation. However, this solution may require a large memory for the look-up table. Thus, off-line PWM strategy in case of dc voltage source variation may not be a suitable approach to control the converter. In this paper, an on-line step pulse PWM method will be proposed to control fundamental voltage and reduce the amplitudes of low-order harmonics to possibly low values. Similar to the original on-line method, the control principle between two defined trajectories will be appropriately modified for solving the problem. The principle is mathematically formulated, and demonstrated by simulation results.","arnumber":"4107307","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Simple On-line Step Pulse PWM Method for Unbalanced Voltage Sources in Cascade Multilevel Inverters]]>","partnum":"4107307","pubtitle":"Strategic Technology, The 1st International Forum on","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4107307","epage":"46","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4107307&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"572","punumber":"4107286","publicationid":"4107307","doi":"10.1109\/IFOST.2006.312242"},{"isbn":"0-7803-9009-1","py":"2005","spage":"663","abstract":"A high-speed and high-power density electrical motor is needed for air compressor which supplies highly pressured air to fuel cell system.

The use of photovoltaic panels, fuel cells and\/or batteries, connected to the DC bus of the three-phase VSI inverter, supplies to the system the energy necessary for generation. Depending the voltage of the DC sources, the connection to the VSI inverter is done directly or via a DC\/DC converter. In this paper SAPC\/G is applied to compensate inefficiencies in unbalanced systems with delta linear loads connected to three-phase system at the same time that is generating active power. SAPC\/G reference currents are obtained from the sensed voltages and currents in the point of common connection (pcc) with the load. The current and voltage symmetrical components are obtained applying Stokvis-Fortescue transformation. The new method of the SAPC\/G reference currents uses the current symmetrical components in the load and a generating current term that depends on the maximum power point of photovoltaic panels. A MPPT algorithm indicates the energy available from the photovoltaic panels that can be transformed in useful electrical energy as an AC three-phase balanced current. The system improves the efficiency of the electrical system and can be used to prevent faults in the distribution lines. All the control systems are done with the digital processor TMS320LF2407.

For these applications, the understanding of transport properties is of primer importance since they directly influence the efficiency of the devices. In this respect, impedance spectroscopy is a widely used tool in the analysis of the material conductivity. It involves the measurement of the impedance of the studied sample in a range of frequencies. A suitable representation of the impedance values allows separating the contribution of the bulk and the grain boundaries. In the present study, the influence of the grain size distribution in the conductivity of 2D polycrystals is modeled considering the nanocrystalline case. With this aim, artificial 2D polycrystal images were simulated with different grain size distributions. From those images, equivalent RC impedance networks were built. The electrical response of the constructed circuit is calculated for various frequencies. The results obtained allow the discussion of the validity of the brick layer model as a function of grain size distribution and grain boundary-to-bulk conductivity ratios. We show that, when starting from a brick layer model, a progressive disordering of the structure is accompanied by a diminution of the overall resistance. This decrease is directly correlated to the augmentation of the linear density of grain boundary. In other words, for a given crystal size, a greater specific surface leads to a lowering of the grain boundary resistance. For high levels of disorders i.e. for wide grain size distributions, another effect becomes predominant. It consists on the appearance of some very conductive pathways associated with big grains and a few number of grain boundaries to cross. This leads to a strong inhomogeneity of current flows as shown on figure 5.","arnumber":"1504363","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Simulation of the influence of particle size distribution and grain boundary resistance on the electrical response of 2D polycrystals]]>","partnum":"1504363","pubtitle":"Electron Devices, 2005 Spanish Conference on","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1504363","epage":"228","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1504363&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"597","punumber":"10056","publicationid":"1504363","doi":"10.1109\/SCED.2005.1504363"},{"isbn":"1-4244-0726-5","py":"2006","spage":"1706","abstract":"Hybrid energy systems are increasingly being applied in areas where grid extension is considered uneconomical.

At present, there is no international standard in place for the calculation of CO<sub>2<\/sub> emission reduction credits from geological storage. The determination of the gross storage of CO<sub>2<\/sub> in a geological setting is relatively easy through the use of standard metering systems at the wellhead. This does not account for the many factors that could be considered to affect the net storage of CO<sub>2<\/sub>. Net calculations will require the development of standards that are consistent with other forms of storage (biological storage for example) and will include surface leakage, length of time storage is required, definition of the injection zone, subsurface CO<sub>2<\/sub> migration, recycling penalties, etc. The CO<sub>2<\/sub> credit may well be less than the gross amount of CO<sub>2<\/sub> injected because of any CO<sub>2<\/sub> penalty that might be imposed. This could be considered as a discount factor that would be applied to each tonne of CO<sub>2<\/sub> stored in the subsurface. Determining a discount factor will require a complete understanding of the lifecycle of the CO<sub>2<\/sub> injected into the subsurface, including projections of the fate of this CO<sub>2<\/sub> over time. Allocation of emissions at various stages of the lifecycle will be achieved by application of a clear set of definitions that will allow these emissions to be inventoried. There will need to be a clear understanding of what is meant by leakage and of how the inventories will be developed. This paper focuses on the assessment of net and gross storage calculations for the CO<sub>2<\/sub> to be injected into the subsurface, with a brief review of some of the issues requiring definition to assess subsurface net storage calculations.","arnumber":"4057308","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Assessing Net and Gross Storage of CO2 in the Subsurface and the Implication for CO2 Credits]]>","partnum":"4057308","pubtitle":"EIC Climate Change Technology, 2006 IEEE","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4057308","epage":"5","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4057308&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"616","punumber":"4057290","publicationid":"4057308","doi":"10.1109\/EICCCC.2006.277178"},{"isbn":"0-7803-8738-4","py":"2005","spage":"571","abstract":"This paper presents a new 3-phase step-up DC-DC converter with a 3-phase high frequency isolation transformer.

The need for ever higher power, specific power, areal power density, and radiation resistance continues to push development of novel solar cell technologies. To meet present and future space power requirements, conventional crystalline multijunction solar cells, next generation thin-film solar cells, and novel technologies are being pursued. In the near to mid term, III-V based multijunction solar cell efficiencies are being increased through incorporation of new materials and metamorphic structures. These efforts are expected to result in AM0 solar cell efficiencies of 33-35%. For thin-film solar cells, significant progress has been made in moving to lightweight polymer substrates and incorporation of monolithic integration, pushing cell level specific powers over 1800 W\/kg. Efficiencies continue to increase through better process control and post process treatments. Incorporation of new materials and tandem structures promises to further increase thin-film solar cell efficiencies. For the longer term, novel material systems and nanotechnologies are being investigated. Examples are InGaN alloys which show promise for a continuously varied bandgap with composition, and intermediate bandgap or nanostructured solar cells which take advantage of size dependant light absorption to absorb more of the solar spectrum.

This paper describes a possible means for launching thousands of tons of propellant per year into LEO at a cost 15 to 30 times less than the current launch cost per kilogram. The basic idea is to mass-produce very simple, small and relatively low-performance rockets at a cost per kilogram comparable to automobiles, instead of the ~&gt;25times greater cost that is customary for current launch vehicles that are produced in small quantities and which are manufactured with performance near the limits of what is possible. These small, simple rockets can reach orbit because they are launched above &gt;95% of the atmosphere, where the drag losses even on a small rocket are acceptable, and because they can be launched nearly horizontally with very simple guidance based largely on spin-stabilization. Launching above most of the atmosphere is accomplished by winching the rocket up a tether to a balloon. A fuel depot in equatorial orbit passes over the launch site on every orbit (approximately every 90 minutes). One or more rockets can be launched each time the fuel depot passes overhead, so the launch rate can be any multiple of ~6000 small rockets per year, a number that is sufficient to reap the benefits of mass production","arnumber":"1656000","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Low-cost propellant launch to Earth orbit from a tethered balloon]]>","partnum":"1656000","pubtitle":"Aerospace Conference, 2006 IEEE","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1656000","epage":"","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1656000&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"625","punumber":"11012","publicationid":"1656000","doi":"10.1109\/AERO.2006.1656000"},{"isbn":"1-4244-0158-5","py":"2006","spage":"1","abstract":"In recent times, diesel powered hybrid electric vehicles have attracted their fair share of attention from automakers worldwide. It is a well-known fact that diesel hybrid technology is being used increasingly to improve the performance of a number of city transit buses. The exclusive combination of advanced diesel engines and sophisticated hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) technologies holds much promise for dramatic reductions in both emissions as well as fuel consumption. Currently, transit bus manufacturers incorporate the popularly accepted series or parallel hybrid electric drive train architectures for hybridization depending on specific performance demands. From the point of view of heavy-duty vehicular drive train hybridization, a major debate in the auto industry involves analyzing and comparing both the series as well as parallel HEV systems. Keeping this issue in mind, this paper aims to comprehensively investigate and evaluate series and parallel hybrid electric drive train topologies for heavy-duty diesel transit buses from the point of view of overall efficiency and parametric performance studies. In general, the vital proposal of this paper involves the depiction of suitability of parallel hybrid drive trains over series hybrid drive trains, more specific to city transit bus applications","arnumber":"4211264","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Comparative Investigation of Series and Parallel Hybrid Electric Drive Trains for Heavy-Duty Transit Bus Applications]]>","partnum":"4211264","pubtitle":"Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference, 2006.

The rocket motor uses hydrogen peroxide as oxidizer and hydrocarbon based chemical as fuel. Also some metal salts are added into the fuel in order to attain hypergolic ignition. The fuel and oxidizer are fed into the system by using high pressure nitrogen gas. The control of pressurized fuel and oxidizer into the motor combustion chamber is achieved by using pressure operated valves and a control card. Mass flow rates of oxidizer and fuel are controlled by using cavitating venturis. In order to improve the combustion performance, an unlike triple impinging type injector is used to spray the fuel and injector into the combustion chamber. Before the testing of the liquid propellant rocket motor (LPRM) system, some simplified tests were performed on subsystems. These tests include flow rate check tests, hypergolic ignition tests and flow tinting tests. This paper contains the detailed explanation of the liquid propellant rocket motor system that has been ground tested, and the results of the tests performed. The ground tests were performed at the static test ramp, at TUBITAK-SAGE, Ankara. In the first motor test no data is taken and the general characteristic of the rocket motor is observed by using normal speed and high-speed cameras. In later tests two pressure transducers is mounted on the rocket liquid propellant rocket motor (LPRM) System. The first transducer is mounted to the rocket motor body to measure the combustion chamber pressure and the second one is mounted at the exit of the cavitating venturi. The rocket motor aluminum case is instrumented with three strain gages and two temperature sensors. A third temperature sensor is also placed at the nozzle exit to measure the nozzle exit gas temperature.","arnumber":"1512584","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Ground testing of a liquid fueled rocket motor]]>","partnum":"1512584","pubtitle":"Recent Advances in Space Technologies, 2005.

Unlike for traditional fossil fuel technologies, greenhouse gas emissions from renewable technologies are associated mainly with the construction of a power plant. With present costs of wind and solar electricity, it is shown that, when electricity from renewable sources replaces electricity from natural gas, the cost of greenhouse gas emissions abatement is about four times less than the cost if hydrogen from renewable sources replaces hydrogen produced from natural gas. When renewable-based hydrogen is used instead of gasoline in a fuel cell vehicle, the cost of greenhouse gas emissions reduction approaches the same value as for renewable-based electricity only if the fuel cell vehicle efficiency exceeds significantly (i.e., by about two times) that of an internal combustion vehicle. It is also shown that when 6000 turbines (Kenetech KVS-33) with a capacity 350 kW and a capacity factor of 24% replace a 500-MW gas-fired power generation plant with an efficiency of 40%, annual greenhouse gas emissions are reduced by 2.3 megatons.

The estimates of the energy production limits are established for each technology, based on available global material reserves. It is shown that many existing technologies, albeit playing an important in the present sub-GW energy production levels, are affected by severe material shortages, preventing their scale-up to the terawatt range. This is the case for thin film solar cells technologies based on CdTe and CIGS where the showstopper is the scarcity of tellurium and indium respectively. Despite the abundance of silicon, crystalline Si solar cells will hardly surpass the few terawatt range as further scale-up will be impeded by the global reserves of silver, commonly used as electrode material. For amorphous silicon and dye sensitized thin film technologies, avoiding the use of ITO transparent conductive oxides (ZnO for a-Si and SnO<sub>2<\/sub> for dye sensitized cells) should favor access to terawatt levels. For existing III-V concentrator cells, operating under moderate concentration (&lt;200X), one to two terawatt year level can be afforded by simply substituting Ge substrates by more abundant GaAs wafer.

In order to maximize the benefits to be obtained by the introduction of these vehicles it is necessary to keep the cost attractive to the potential purchaser, so that fuel savings are not outweighed by increased purchase cost. Raw materials cost suggests that no major reduction in the cost of nickel batteries can be anticipated and thus considerable interest attaches to the possibility that batteries based on less expensive materials may be able to perform the necessary function, at least for medium and mild hybrids.

Many factors involve in designing HEVs such as fuel consumption, emission and performance. A major challenge for development of hybrid vehicles is coordination of multiple energy sources and converters, and in case of a HEV, power flow control for both mechanical and electrical path. This necessitates the utilization of appropriate control or energy management strategy. Furthermore, the durability extension of some critical components in the drive train such as batteries tends to be one of the substantial factors considered in designing control strategies for HEVs. In this paper two novel issues are considered in designing energy management systems for series HEVs. In the first part, we propose an algorithm such that the future path information of the vehicles is also taken into account for generating the control signals. Using global positioning system (GPS) installed today in most of the vehicles, such data are fed to the central vehicle controller. A fuzzy logic controller (FLC) is utilized for energy management based on the predicted future state of the vehicle, in order to improve fuel consumption, emission and performance. Then, the energy management system is modified to increase the state of the health (SOH) of the power train battery. This approach, which results in the extension of the battery life, is called predictive and protective algorithm (PPA). The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed controllers.","arnumber":"4156554","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[A Fuzzy Energy Management Strategy for Series Hybrid Electric Vehicle with Predictive Control and Durability Extension of the Battery]]>","partnum":"4156554","pubtitle":"Electric and Hybrid Vehicles, 2006.

The final landing site is determined via probabilistic reasoning based on terrain safety derived from on-board sensors, available fuel based on spacecraft descent dynamics, and regions of interest defined by mission scientists","arnumber":"4059234","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[A Bayesian Framework for Landing Site Selection during Autonomous Spacecraft Descent]]>","partnum":"4059234","pubtitle":"Intelligent Robots and Systems, 2006 IEEE\/RSJ International Conference on","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4059234","epage":"5117","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4059234&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"664","punumber":"4058334","publicationid":"4059234","doi":"10.1109\/IROS.2006.282603"},{"isbn":"0-7803-9215-9","py":"2005","spage":"366","abstract":"The potential for reduced fuel consumption of hybrid electric vehicles by the use of predictive powertrain control was assessed.

Boost converters are especially useful in stepping-up the voltage from a battery or fuel cell to match the electric motor voltage range. However, conventional high-power boost converters are very large and heavy, partly due to the large inductors used in the design. These heavy components negatively affect the fuel economy of the vehicles, add cost to the vehicle, and may add difficulty for packaging. The solution is to implement a method which reduces the switching losses in the converter so that the switching frequency can be increased and hence the size of the inductors, and overall converter, can be reduced. This paper proposes a new lossless snubber circuit that greatly reduces the switching losses of the IGBT in the converter. The circuit uses no additional magnetic components, has a simple control strategy, is relatively low-cost, and is shown to provide a boost in efficiency even while greatly reducing the size of the converter.

Declining growth of minerals demand, improved technology for land based production and the opening of Russian nickel production to the world market all combined to push seabed mining off to the distant future. The interest in deep ocean mineral development, which had been driven by technological capability, died from lack of economic prospects. In the future, economics will be in the forefront and technology will play the supporting role. That future is some years off, but the prospects for seabed mineral development are improving. Demand for nickel, largely for the production of stainless steel, has been growing at a high and consistent rate driven by China's rapidly growing economy. This will continue as other countries transition from developing to developed economies. Nickel demand is also feeling the effect of increased use of nickel-metal hydride batteries in consumer goods, and there is massive growth potential as automobile electrical systems are redesigned for higher power requirements and for the electric drive systems of hybrid and fuel cell vehicles. Cobalt also stands to share in this increased demand as lithium ion batteries that utilize cobalt to obtain a higher energy density compete with other battery systems. Demand for copper will also respond to increased industrialization and the redesign of the automobile. Just as prices for nickel were depressed when Russian industrial demand dropped precipitously in the early 1990s and domestic production was sold to the world market, the eventual recovery of the Russian economy will remove that substantial source from the world market and prices will move upward. Development prospects are not limited to hard minerals. The exploitation of marine methane hydrate- - s on the slopes of the continental shelf and in the valleys of offshore ridge systems offers commercial potential in a generation or two. Although it may be 50 years or more before methane hydrates become a major component of the world's energy supply, they may be developed decades earlier in response to particular combinations of regional demand and well formed deposits in geographically favorable locations. These circumstances suggest that Japan and India may be among the earliest developers of this resource. The outlook for deep ocean mineral development will initially be driven by regional economic demand and by specific technologies and deposits. Those wishing to profit from the development of deep ocean resources are advised to examine these segments of the world minerals market and technologies and then develop commercial relationships with them in mind. By participating in these early development opportunities, ocean engineering firms stand to gain a significant advantage in subsequent, more lucrative ocean minerals projects as markets and technologies make the resources more attractive","arnumber":"1639936","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[What was old is new again: economic potential of deep ocean minerals the second time around]]>","partnum":"1639936","pubtitle":"OCEANS, 2005.

Twenty years ago Cuddihy et. al., concluded that elastomeric silicone encapsulants were the only technology to meet all the physical, chemical, spectral, and mechanical demands of photovoltaic modules. In the decades since the decision to excluded silicone in this application for cost reasons, the thermal and photo-degradation of Ethylene Vinyl Acetates, EVAs, continues to be well documented. It can be concluded from recent work on water vapor transmission rates that sufficient water can penetrate today's EVA cells to fuel the corrosion processes mitigating hard fought efficiency gains. Today silicones are in wide-spread use as frame or junction-box sealants in the PV industry to protect against water\/moisture ingress into EVA or electrical connections, as well as to protect bypass diodes and soldering points in junction box potting applications. Future forecast are cure speeds will be ramped up, and PV module prices will be progressively driven down, is it time to reconsider this proven silicone technology?

To this respect ion-engines could help because they are characterized by a high reliability and particular low fuel consumption. On the other hand the thrust is very low, so that long time operation is needed to accomplish the repositioning. First recovery by ion-engines was the unexpected repositioning of the satellite Artemis.

JAXA is presently conducting system-level studies of a microwave-based SSPS (M-SSPS) and laser-based SSPS (L-SSPS). The M-SSPS is comprised of solar energy collection mirrors, power generators (PV arrays), and power transmitters (amplifiers and antennas). The diameter of the primary mirror will be a few kilometres and the total mass will be 10 thousand tons. The electrical power received on Earth from this satellite may be 1 GW. The laser-based SSPS (L-SSPS) uses a laser to transmit power. The laser beam will be generated directly from concentrated solar light using a laser medium. SSPSs have been previously studied as tools to supply energy to Earth. Recent interest in lunar and planetary exploration has drawn attention to the use of SSPSs, since lunar exploration is currently focused on the polar region of the Moon, where little sunlight is available.

The growth rates of TF and x-Si technologies are varied, while overall PV growth is held constant at 30%. For each of these scenarios, we estimate the total investment required for PV to reach a break-even point with fossil fuel based generation; and we investigate the intrinsic\/lowest achievable costs from an analysis of potential materials, processing, and efficiency improvements. Our results show that a high growth rate (50 to 70% per year) of new technologies with low intrinsic costs could decrease the total investment required to reach break-even by up to 70 billion USD, as compared to a scenario where x-Si continues to dominate the market. Furthermore, the system component analysis indicates that existing TF modules can reach the low cost levels assumed in the experience curve model.

The purpose of this testing was to collect data to improve a previously developed compressor health prognostics algorithm. For the purpose of Phase I of this testing, fouling was accomplished by injecting salt into the gas turbine inlet air stream. Phase II of this testing will consist of fouling the middle and back regions of the compressor. Influence coefficients can then be developed for each of these regions indicating how a given region affects overall performance. Typically, in a marine environment, fouling of the front stages occurs due to ingested salt while fouling in middle and rear regions occurs from a combination of ingested salt and oil seal leakage. In order to monitor engine performance, it was necessary to add several sensors to the existing test cell. In addition, hardware was added to both ingest and monitor the concentration of salt in gas turbine inlet air. Preliminary results from Phase I indicate that front stage compressor fouling causes a clear increase in inlet static pressure. This is due to the mass flow restriction through the compressor.

Use of solar cells with lead acid accumulators to provide required power and the use of light emitting diode (LED) displays to function as signal lamps to reduce the stored power consumption will be a feasible solution for the same. Since the LED display consists of a number of LEDs, visibility from side ways is better than the conventional signal lamp having a single light source. Failure of the lamp in the conventional signals halts the entire operation of the signal lamp but in the case of failures of few LEDs in a matrix will not cease the entire operation. In most of the LED display traffic light systems, set of LEDs will not illuminate even when only one of the LEDs burnt out since the set is connected in series. In this design, parallel sets of LEDs are connected in series, and therefore, only the defective LEDs will not be illuminated but all the others will be illuminated. Some major advantages of this system are uninterrupted operation around the clock throughout the year, very low maintenance cost for replacing LEDs and the lead acid batteries, and during the installation of new signal posts it is possible to erect the same as a wireless installation. Solar panel with an accumulator can provide power while infrared sensors and diodes could be used to transfer signals between each signal post, hence it is not necessary to dig across the road for control and power cables. For the safety and the convenience of the pedestrians and vehicular traffic, bi-color seven segment digital displays are available to indicate the waiting time and remaining moving time.

Additionally control of sloshing liquid offers a challenging problem of control of underactuated systems. To study slosh dynamics, develop useful identification schemes, and design and verify slosh control algorithms, a new 2DOF actuation slosh rig is reported in this paper considering the fact that most of the times the liquid tanks are subjected to linear as well as pitching excitation. The paper discusses mechatronic design and several advantages offered by the new design. Furthermore, a mathematical model of the rig is developed using Lagrange formulation assuming two-pendulum model for slosh. Slosh parameter identification with the rig is demonstrated in pitching and linear excitation cases. Nonlinear parameter identification schemes developed using simplified version of rig model are used for the purpose. Further results on compensation of slosh and rotary slosh phenomena are presented. Thus the proposed rig is ideal tool for study, identification, and control of slosh phenomena.","arnumber":"4237830","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Development of 2DOF Actuation Slosh Rig: A Novel Mechatronic System]]>","partnum":"4237830","pubtitle":"Industrial Technology, 2006.

For example, capturing one out of every 10000 photons from the sun would provide all the power the world currently uses. Approximately 75% of the solar radiation striking the upper atmosphere (1368 W\/m<sup>2<\/sup> = 8555 eV\/sec\/nm<sup>2<\/sup> ) reaches the surface of the earth and most of this is in the form of photons with more than 1 eV of energy since water vapor and other atmospheric constituents effectively absorb energy below this threshold. In order to produce a one micron photovoltaic molecular film (composed of approximately 1000 layers of a molecule) with 10-20 percent efficiency, each molecule would have to create 1-3 eV\/sec. Since the available solar radiation is in the 1-4 eV range, this implies ~1-3 electron-hole pairs per second which biological systems currently achieve. As such, various organic molecules, some of which are biologically inspired, have been proposed as alternative building blocks for solar energy materials. In the first phase of our challenge project, we have performed calculations on a molecular triad composed of a fullerene, a porphyrin and a carotenoid polyene. By calculating electronic structures, approximate excited states and respective dipole transition rates, we have simulated charge transfer dynamics in a collection of molecules exposed to an appropriate bath of solar photons. The resulting time constants associated with capture of solar radiation in the form of a charge-separated state have been determined. In the first phase of this challenge project, only electronic excitations were considered in the kinetic Monte Carlo modeling. Furthermore, the low symmetry in the molecular triad made it relatively easy to identify charge transfer excitations. In this phase of the project we rep- - ort four new computationally intensive investigations that are aimed at validating and extending the formalism. First, to justify the use of an approximate excited state formalism, we have performed analogous calculations of excited states on a much larger selection of molecules and atoms and compared these results to experiment. Second we have performed calculations entirely analogous to our earlier molecular-triad results on highly idealized and high-symmetry fullerene tubules. Third we have used and extended a recently developed method to calculate all electron-hole-phonon interactions in these carbon nanotubes as well as the light-harvesting molecular triad. Fourth, in analogy to symmetry-breaking methods used for density-functional treatments of ferro- and ferri- magnetic ordering in molecular magnets, we have developed and tested a massively parallel computational method, employing coarse and fine-grain strategies, for identifying self trapped ferroelectric excited states in highly symmetric carbon nanotubes. These techniques allow us to determine charge-transfer excitations and to determine whether excited-states are to be viewed within a Franck-Condon or Marcus-Hush picture","arnumber":"4134055","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Massively Parallel Simulations on Light-Induced Charge Transfer in Molecules]]>","partnum":"4134055","pubtitle":"HPCMP Users Group Conference, 2006","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4134055","epage":"204","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4134055&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"709","punumber":"4134019","publicationid":"4134055","doi":"10.1109\/HPCMP-UGC.2006.44"},{"isbn":"1-4244-0017-1","py":"2006","spage":"2481","abstract":"Accumulated installations of photovoltaic solar systems in the European Union have reached almost 2 GW at the end of 2005.

Railroad locomotives often have high peak-to-average demand for power, which leads to poor fuel efficiency from diesel prime movers, or arcing and pitting of overhead cantenary. One approach to this problem has been the development of diesel-battery hybrid locomotives. A large bank of lead-acid batteries provides peak instantaneous power, while a constant speed, high-efficiency diesel-electric generator set provides average power to the battery bank. This arrangement has proven practical in the Green Goat and other hybrids, although sizing of the generator set for a particular application, such as switching a railyard, becomes crucial. In addition, battery wear must be accurately predicted for peak performance, and the battery bank itself must be replaced after a few thousand cycles, increasing cost and creating a lead disposal hazard. Advances in capacitor design have created a new family of devices, known as super- or ultracapacitors. These devices have a mass-energy density which approaches lead-acid batteries, but with dramatically lower internal resistance and potentially limitless cycle life. However, the volumetric-energy density is much lower than batteries, thwarting a direct application in a practically sized rail vehicle. In this paper, a multi-stage drive is proposed, which takes advantage of the best properties of each energy storage device - capacitor, lead-acid battery, and diesel prime mover. The capacitor provides high peak instantaneous power, absorbing the cyclic nature of the locomotive's power demands. The battery bank acts as a buffer stage, with fewer full discharge cycles and longer life. The diesel prime mover provides longterm sustaining power for the system. In electric railway applications, adding an ultracapacitor stage reduces peak current through the wire-pantograph interface, reducing wear and improving lifetime of the entire system. By increasing the size of the ultracapacitor stage to practical limits, a traction system may be constructed which reduces or eliminates the need for the cantenary\/third-rail supply and interface, substantially reducing the cost of electrified rail transportation.","arnumber":"1460837","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Multi-stage hybrid drives for traction applications]]>","partnum":"1460837","pubtitle":"Rail Conference, 2005.

Raised blood ketones produced on a very high fat ketogenic diet can significantly reduce seizures in children. Ketones also have other 'protective' effects on the brain but their metabolism by the brain is still poorly understood. The aim of the present work was to assess the brain uptake of <sup>11<\/sup>C-acetoacetate using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. In order to vary plasma ketones, we used rats (3 groups of 4 rats) under three dietary conditions - control diet (high carbohydrate; low plasma ketones), fat-rich ketogenic diet (moderate plasma ketones), and 48 h fasting (moderate plasma ketones). Tissue perfusion of the tracer and oxygen consumption were measured in heart and brain. In brain but not heart, the ketogenic diet enhanced tracer perfusion and oxygen consumption relative to the two other diets. Our data show that the brain's ability to utilize increased availability of blood ketones may relate in some way to concurrent glucose availability.","arnumber":"4179796","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Study of \/sup 11\/C-Acetoacetate Uptake by Rat Heart and Brain Using Small Animal PET Imaging]]>","partnum":"4179796","pubtitle":"Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record, 2006.

The research in this field is usually classified as two directions: optimal path planning without considering the computation cost and real-time suboptimal path planning. Aimed at the two problems, this paper presents two methods of path planning of UAV. One method is based on heuristically search. In this method, we search the threat net by using A-star algorithm. A shortest suboptimum path is obtained, which is composed of the lines on the Voronoi diagram, and then considering the UAV's turn constraint, the path can be smoothed by geometry method. The other method is based on genetic algorithm and potential fields technology. Because potential fields, however popular, have shortcomings, viz, trap situations due to local minima, the genetic algorithm is introduced. In this method, Firstly, construct the threats' Delaunay triangle net based on the principle of nearest neighborhood and a safe planning path goes across the lines of the triangles. Then designate each point (position of a threat) on the left of the path a index 0 and on the right 1 and only designate the points of line which is not passed the same symbol. Thus, based on the directions of passing the lines of Delaunay triangle, a kind of encoding is designed on the principle of \"Left 0, Right 1\". At last, a global planning path can obtained by the genetic algorithm and potential fields technology. At the same time, simulation results of the two path planning methods are given.","arnumber":"1568876","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Flight path planning of UAV based on heuristically search and genetic algorithms]]>","partnum":"1568876","pubtitle":"Industrial Electronics Society, 2005.

Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Controllers (FLCs) can handle such uncertainties; however they have a computational overhead associated with the iterative type-reduction process which can diminish the FLC real-time performance. Furthermore, manually designing a type-2 FLC is a difficult task particularly as the number of membership function parameters and rules increase. In this paper, we will introduce an embedded Real-Time Type-2 Neuro-Fuzzy Controller (RT2NFC) which overcomes the iterative type-reduction overhead and learns the parameters of interval type-2 FLC for marine engines. We have performed numerous experiments on a real diesel engine testing platform in which we compared our RT2NFC to a T2NFC based on the iterative type reduction procedure. Both T2NFCs were embedded on an industrial microcontroller platform where they handled the uncertainties to produce accurate and robust speed controllers that outperformed the currently used commercial engine controller. The RT2NFC gave approximately the same control response as the T2NFC, whilst the RT2NFC avoided the type-reduction overhead thus giving a faster real-time response.","arnumber":"1681899","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Using Uncertainty Bounds in the Design of an Embedded Real-Time Type-2 Neuro-Fuzzy Speed Controller for Marine Diesel Engines]]>","partnum":"1681899","pubtitle":"Fuzzy Systems, 2006 IEEE International Conference on","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1681899","epage":"1453","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1681899&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"725","punumber":"11093","publicationid":"1681899","doi":"10.1109\/FUZZY.2006.1681899"},{"isbn":"0-7803-9296-5","py":"2005","spage":"489","abstract":"An improved perturb-and-observe maximum power point tracking algorithm is presented that incorporates a current compensated converter.

The developed thermal conductivity microsensor is ascribed to microsystems technology. It integrates two Pt thermoresistors each patterned on a microbridge, defined in turn in the silicon substrate by surface micromachining. Porous silicon is used as sacrificial layer. In the considered methane number range (60-100), a linear output with a sensitivity of 0.95mV\/1MN is obtained when a 50mA constant current is applied to the sensing thermoresistor. Furthermore, microdevice is mounted in a gas line rig in order to test it in field.

The performance calculation tools are modularly structured and synthesize the performance of the engine based on the characteristics of its individual components. Using these tools, a full thermodynamic model of nearly any engine configuration can be set up, allowing the calculation of engine performance with sufficient accuracy. During engine development programs the evaluation of the engine performance from test data is generally accomplished by a model-based analysis procedure. Compared with in-service engines the performance instrumentation of development engines is very extensive. With such instrumentation it is possible to break down the engine performance to component level. The basis of the analysis procedure is a full thermodynamic model representing the expected component characteristics of the engine. The model is matched to the engine test data on a component level by applying so-called modifiers. On the one hand this allows calculating all data which is not directly measured, e.g. turbine temperatures, efficiencies and specific fuel consumption. On the other hand a comparison between the test data and the expected component characteristics is performed. The deviations are characterized by the derived modifiers. The way the comparison is done allows analyzing the components almost separately from each other and thus matching effects are nearly eliminated.

These processes are introduced in the paper and explained within the context of pavement management. Several empirically-derived indicators, many of them used in pavement design or to aid in operational decision-making, have been developed by engineers and are available to evaluate the potential effects of climate change. Three such indicators were applied in a Muskoka, Ontario case study to baseline climate data and a conservative mid-century scenario of climate change (HadCM3-A2x). The results of the analysis illustrate that even modest climate change may have important implications for the long-term maintenance of the Canadian road network.","arnumber":"4057315","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Climate Change and the Performance of Pavement Infrastructure in Southern Canada: Context and Case Study]]>","partnum":"4057315","pubtitle":"EIC Climate Change Technology, 2006 IEEE","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4057315","epage":"9","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4057315&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"737","punumber":"4057290","publicationid":"4057315","doi":"10.1109\/EICCCC.2006.277185"},{"isbn":"1-4244-0017-1","py":"2006","spage":"1939","abstract":"The Solar Power Satellite System is a concept to collect solar power in space, and then transport it to the surface of the Earth by microwave (or possibly laser) beam, where it is converted into electrical power for terrestrial use.

The state Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) has been accelerated with the target to meet twenty percent electricity demand of the state with renewable resources by 2010. The California Solar Initiative (CSI) calls for 3.0 GW of solar photovoltaic (PV) power by 2016. The Western Governors Association (WGA) has set a target of reaching 30.0 GW of clean, diversified energy by 2015. Solar energy is expected to be a major contributor in meeting these targets. However, the relatively high cost of solar power presents significant barriers for the solar industry. This paper briefly reviews the opportunities, challenges and barriers faced by the solar industry and presents results of a study conducted by California Energy Commission (CEC). Technical and economic feasibility of California solar resources (both PV and CSP) and impacts of injecting solar power into the electricity grid at strategic locations is examined. Some of the major findings include: In the near term PV power still needs to rely on incentives to be cost competitive with other resources, however the economics significantly improves when time of use and tiered rates, long term financing, and non-energy benefits are considered. Approximately 500 MW of residential PV could be deployed in California by 2010 and over 2000 MW by 2017.

This is because the distribution of the receipt of GFO insurance is exceedingly asymmetric due to the discrete nature of the outages and the unique characteristics of the electricity market that makes possible the presence of price spikes. This valuation problem is dealt with herein by decomposing the original asymmetric receipt distribution into two approximating normal distributions. Then, using the approximating distributions, a generalized method of evaluating insurance on GFO is presented.

While approximately half of the CO<sub>2<\/sub> has remained in the atmosphere long-term, most of the rest has been absorbed by the surface ocean. This has resulted in a lowering of the surface ocean pH by about 0.1 units since the beginning of the industrial revolution and if society is able to stabilize atmospheric CO<sub>2<\/sub> levels at twice their pre-industrial concentrations will result in a lowering of surface ocean pH by 0.25 units. While many are asking the question of whether we should pursue direct ocean CO<sub>2<\/sub> sequestration, the FOCE experiment is asking what will be the impact of the pH change on the ocean. In order to address this question, MBARI science and engineering have designed a small-scale in situ CO<sub>2<\/sub> enrichment experiment to assess the chemical and biological impacts in a manner analogous to the land-based Free Air CO<sub>2<\/sub> Enrichment (FACE) experiments.

Best practice is to use super-capacitors with batteries, reducing the deep charge-discharge cycle and battery size. According to the energy requirements of the EV bus, the control strategies of the energy management system about the dynamic battery and super-capacitor EV bus are studied. With batteries and super-capacitors electric vehicle as the main research subjects, which runs between system and parts time after time, different parts of the dynamic model was built, which include road-load model, super-capacitors model, direct current link model, power transform model and system circuit model etc. The electric vehicle simulation model with the control system of the multi-energy dynamic assembly is built, and simulated, in the ECE 15 which is an urban driving cycle and EDUC (extra urban driving cycle). Simulation results show that the dynamic performance is increased with super-capacitors in the same condition. Based on simulation, average energy consumptions with super-capacitors and without super-capacitors are calculated in typical urban driving and suburb driving cycles respectively. Calculations show that whilst average energy consumption with super-capacitors in urban driving cycle is reduced, this is not so in the suburb driving cycle. The developing low floorboard EV bus (BK6121EV) with multi-energy dynamic assembly system was used to experiment on the test road surface of Tong county in Beijing city, under the different states of the super-capacitors controller on-off. The trend of tested data curve is consistent with the simulation. With super-capacitors, dynamic performance is improved, and both traction battery current and average energy consumption are decreased.

Therefore, a method is proposed to let dispersed power sources participate in voltage control and primary frequency control. The method is specifically meant for dispersed sources that are connected to the power system via a power electronic interface, such as photovoltaic systems, variable speed wind turbines and fuel cells. The method takes advantage of the possibilities to control the active and reactive current of the power electronic interface independently, within limits imposed by the prime mover and the converter rating.

Installing a super-capacitor as an auxiliary power source to improve the performance of electric vehicles is a feasible and realistic solution. In this paper, the structure of a multi-energy system and the principles of flow of the multi energy of electric vehicles were introduced first, explaining how different sources of energy work in different situations. A model of electric vehicle with a battery and a super-capacitor, based on Matlab\/Simulink was built up. The model was validated by comparing the simulation results and the actual data from later field tests. The drive cycle used in the simulation was the CYC_CONST_45. Comparisons were made between the model of the vehicle with a super-capacitor and the model of a vehicle without a super-capacitor. Field tests of an electric vehicle were conduct and analyses were made. The analysis includes vehicle dynamic performance and economical performance in urban environments where the vehicle accelerated and decelerated frequently. The results showed that installing a super-capacitor improves the working conditions of the battery. The variation of the current drawn by the vehicle was smoothed due to the working of the super-capacitor, which provided better working conditions for the battery and increased the operating life of the battery. A super-capacitor can also improve the acceleration performance of the vehicle. The super-capacitor could provide large current in short time, delivering extra energy to meet the energy requirement when it is needed. A battery and a super-capacitor working together can reduce the average energy consumption. The average energy consumption of a vehicle with a super-capacitor is only 77% of that of a vehicle without a super-capacitor.

In the past, battery technology such as sealed lead acid was fairly simple to design into a system. Battery cells could be strapped in series and parallel to achieve the desired voltage, current and total capacity. This is not possible with rechargeable lithium-ion technology, as the charge and discharge of each cell needs to be carefully monitored and controlled to keep the devices safe. Lithium-ion cells provide some of the highest energy density of any high volume battery technology as well as a very low cost as the technology is driven by notebook computer industry. This paper describes a new patent-pending technology that allows system designers to build lithium-ion battery systems using off the shelf pre-engineered components. The system uses small lithium-ion smart battery packs and combines them into groups of any size to create very large battery power systems. The technology scales from a few battery packs to hundreds of packs. This technology is being used in AUV and UUV designs as well as buoys and other marine and nonmarine devices. A family of DC-DC converters can provide high power regulated output voltages from 33V to 144V for directly powering user devices. \"Battery Clusters\" can be configured to fully charge in under two hours, in place with a simple two wire DC charge voltage input, or they can charge from weak sources such as solar panels, wind generators or water turbines.","arnumber":"1639734","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Battery arrays, rechargable Li-ion battery power sources for marine applications]]>","partnum":"1639734","pubtitle":"OCEANS, 2005.

Moreover, battery temperature increase and gasses production related to overcharging make necessary to detect accurately the end of fast-charge to avoid battery damage. Limited information about results of charging process at different charging rates (i.e. time reduction versus charge efficiency) makes difficult to select the optimum rate in each specific application. The lack of information is more problematic in NiMH batteries due to they can not support as well as NiCd batteries extreme working conditions.

The field winding always receives constant current while the armature current varies depending on the load and the ambient condition, such that the maximum available power is drawn from the PV source. Therefore, the characteristic of a permanent magnet dc motor is achieved using a low cost separately excited dc motor.

During a battery's lifetime, its performance slowly deteriorates because of the degradation of its electrochemical constituents. Battery manufacturers usually provide aging data that will show this degradation. However the data they provide result from standard aging tests, in which the battery is discharged and charged thousands of times with identical current profiles (or cycles). Using these data many aging models have been developed that relate the maximum number of battery cycles to the depth of discharge (DOD) of the current profile used. In this work, we focus on the development of an aging model suitable for applications in which the battery is used with no pre-defined cycles, as in the case of hybrid-electric vehicles. Laboratory experiments and concepts borrowed from fatigue analysis are applied to the relationship between battery aging and the most important operational conditions that affect its life, i.e. its operating temperature and current history.","arnumber":"1554536","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[An aging model of Ni-MH batteries for hybrid electric vehicles]]>","partnum":"1554536","pubtitle":"Vehicle Power and Propulsion, 2005 IEEE Conference","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1554536","epage":"","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1554536&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"795","punumber":"10416","publicationid":"1554536","doi":"10.1109\/VPPC.2005.1554536"},{"isbn":"1-4244-0448-7","py":"2006","spage":"1","abstract":"This paper proposes a hybrid energy system combing solar photovoltaic and wind turbine as a small-scale alternative source of electrical energy where conventional generation is not practical.

Due to significant fluctuations in power generation and consumption, the application of batteries in small stand-alone renewable power system is rather complicated. Maintaining the power balance leads to high fluctuations in the battery charge and discharge currents. This is in contrast with the smooth and limited charge and discharge currents that are recommended by battery manufacturers. Uncontrolled use of batteries will shorten the battery lifespan very fast; however frequent conditioning of the batteries may reduce this effect significantly. This paper describes the impact of these effects on the system control and operation and presents some solutions to deal with battery storage in this specific application.

An experimental procedure measured the real efficiency of an entire system, that is about 50% of the solar radiation available over the solar modules, which is different from the 84% rate available from the bibliography","arnumber":"4104641","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Global Performance Measurement of a Stand-Alone Photovoltaic System]]>","partnum":"4104641","pubtitle":"Transmission & Distribution Conference and Exposition: Latin America, 2006.

By adopting a balanced portfolio of electricity and hydrogen production that is market driven, a generation mix of advanced nuclear designs with supplementary wind power provides a route towards a secure, sustainable and safe energy future Primary energy supply is on the threshold of a revolution as profound as utilization of carbon-based fuels by the Industrial Revolution. Improved energy efficiency is insufficient to bring CO<sub>2<\/sub> emissions under control since the new revolution must cope with rapid expansion of energy demand in the economies of the Developing World as they climb toward Developed World levels of wealth. Three broad options exist for acceptable, primary energy supply: nuclear, renewables, and carbon with sequestration. From all of these, energy will emerge increasingly as electricity and require some form of storage. Hydrogen is ideal both for storage of electricity and as a transportation fuel producing minimal greenhouse gas emissions. The required scale of new primary energy deployment is so large that choosing between the three supply technologies is pointless: one should identify ways in which they can most effectively be blended. NuWindcopy is one such blend. It addresses the problem of wind's short-term and seasonal intermittency and unpredictability. The extent to which wind's variability can be absorbed as electricity depends on the mix of other generation capacity on a power grid but wind power can usually contribute only a fairly small percentage before the need for back-up capacity becomes burdensome. This has led to the suggestion of converting wind-generated electricity into hydrogen by electrolysis. However, simple analysis shows that wind's low average output inflates the cost of electrolysis equipment beyond economic competitiveness. With NuWind, judicious application- - of time-of-day variability in the value of electricity subsidizes the cost of electrolytic equipment. When the value of electricity is high, electricity is sold to the grid. When the value of electricity to the grid is low, electricity from both nuclear and wind sources are converted into hydrogen using cells designed to handle varying current density. If the wind is blowing, the current to the electrolysis cells is turned up. Low-cost cavern storage for hydrogen accommodates seasonal swings in the wind component. Using hourly electricity price data from Ontario and Alberta and typical hourly wind data, the economics of large-scale hydrogen production by NuWind are shown to be comparable with those of steam-methane reforming with sequestration. Over a wide range of electricity to hydrogen ratios, the estimated cost of bulk, undistributed hydrogen production by Nu Wind is below the US DOE's target of 2000 $\/tonne (all dollars quoted are U.S.). All nuclear and aeolian generation is always available to the grid at times of high demand.","arnumber":"4057317","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Integrating Large-Scale Co-Generation of Hydrogen and Electricity from Wind and Nuclear Sources (Nuwind Â©)]]>","partnum":"4057317","pubtitle":"EIC Climate Change Technology, 2006 IEEE","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4057317","epage":"9","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4057317&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"817","punumber":"4057290","publicationid":"4057317","doi":"10.1109\/EICCCC.2006.277187"},{"isbn":"1-4244-0110-0","py":"2006","spage":"1","abstract":"This paper attempts to identify the best multi-level topology (cost and performance) for grid-connected converters supplied from residential renewable sources.

For low switching frequencies (i.e. negligible switching losses), comparably efficient converters can be cheaper by implementing a multi-cell design. However, if the efficiency of such designs is to exceed that of the single-cell designs, the converter cost can become disadvantageous.

In this respect, oxygen sensors take a very important role in the control of the oxygen-to-fuel ratio in the mixture of combusting engines (Tifee et al., 2001). High temperature electrochemical sensors based on solid electrolytes have been the subject of much research in the last 20 years, leading to very successful industrial applications. Nevertheless, many improvements are still required in matter of roughness, long term stability, detection range and response speed. In the present work, a novel design and fabrication method of an amperometric oxygen sensor have been developed. Its main originality entails the use of an yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) porous layer which acts both as an oxygen conductor (electrolyte) and as a gas diffusion barrier. The electrodes were deposited using a commercial platinum paste. The entire device has been fabricated by means of an optimized screen printing method. The exclusive use of this innovative technique has permitted the implementation of a very compact planar device in an easy, fast and highly economical way. The sensor has been structurally characterized using SEM, revealing a very uniform-shaped micro-stack. Electrical measurements show a behavior typical of that expected from amperometric oxygen sensors (Garzon, 1998). The device developed with a linear output and a good selectivity in a wide range of oxygen partial pressures. Moreover, the response to changes in the atmosphere composition was almost immediate.

An algorithm has been developed for robots which explore the environment to measure the physical properties (temperature in this paper). While the robot is moving, it measures the temperature and registers the value in the corresponding grid cell. The robot moves from local maximum to local minimum, then to another local maximum, and repeats. To reach the local maximum or minimum, simple gradient following is used. Robust estimation of the gradient using perturbation\/correlation is described. By introducing the probability of each grid cell, and considering the probability distribution, the robot doesn't have to visit all the grid cells in the environment still providing fast and efficient sensing. Once the robot visited most of the local maximum\/minimum, then the gradients at the remaining cells are close to zero. Then, the robot simply follows the Voronoi edges to complete the exploration. The extended algorithm to coordinate multiple robots is shown with simulation results","arnumber":"1507513","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Exploration algorithm for multiple robots]]>","partnum":"1507513","pubtitle":"Advanced Robotics, 2005.

The problem with these settlements is that they generally have no access to the electric grid and often lack basic infrastructure. Technological developments such as the photo-voltaic power system has brought a lot of relief which helps to alleviate the energy problems experienced by the developing communities, as these systems are easy to install, low maintenance, modular and cost effective with regards to energy generation. This paper provides the analysis of the steady-state performance and dynamics of the photovoltaic fuel generator (PVFC) for localized load management in standalone systems. The results obtained for the dynamic and steady state characteristics are presented and discussed. Photovoltaic systems have been employed in driving different types of load, such as direct current motors; therefore understanding the system operation and matching of the system components for a particular PV system and load type are important factors in system design.","arnumber":"1529625","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Dynamics of a solar-powered fractional horse power motor]]>","partnum":"1529625","pubtitle":"Electrical and Electronics Engineering, 2005 2nd International Conference on","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1529625","epage":"277","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1529625&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"833","punumber":"10241","publicationid":"1529625","doi":"10.1109\/ICEEE.2005.1529625"},{"isbn":"0-7803-9098-9","py":"2005","spage":"2141","abstract":"In this paper, we present a novel switching traffic-responsive ramp-metering controller that adapts to the different traffic dynamics under different congestion conditions - free-flow or congested. The approach of multirate linear quadratic control with integral action (LQI) is employed to compensate for disturbances and to accommodate the difference between the model sampling time and the metering-rate update interval. In addition, a queue length regulator is designed to prevent the queue from exceeding the ramp storage capacity and yield improved performance over the currently used ad hoc \"queue-override\" scheme. A local ramp-metering control strategy is proposed to achieve the control goal of reducing the spatial and temporal span of the congestion, while satisfying the on-ramp storage capacity constraints, using locally available information. Test results on a calibrated cell transmission model (CTM) based macroscopic traffic simulator have demonstrated the performance and effectiveness of the switching ramp-metering controller, the queue length regulator, and the control strategy. The switching metering controller tracks the desired mainline density profiles in both free-flow and congested conditions. Under the localized control strategy, the total vehicle delay is reduced by 7.7%, while the total vehicle time is reduced by 5.7%, in the CTM traffic simulator.","arnumber":"1470287","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[A localized switching ramp-metering controller with a queue length regulator for congested freeways]]>","partnum":"1470287","pubtitle":"American Control Conference, 2005.

The vehicle that is driven by an electric motor can provide a quick acceleration response that depends on the characteristics of the motor's torque response. However, at the same time, the fast acceleration rate of the motor torque causes an uncomfortable shaking vibration that originates from the twisting torque of the drive shaft. To achieve a balance between the vehicle accelerating performance and the comfortable ride, a new shaking vibration control method is proposed. The proposed control system is composed of a feed-forward compensator with an inverse filter and a feedback compensator by applying a perfect zeroing method. The feed-forward filter can suppress a shaking vibration induced by motor output torque, and the feedback compensator suppresses a shaking vibration caused by a disturbance input such as a model error or a disturbance torque input. Driving tests were conducted with an experimental fuel cell vehicle operated by an electric motor control. According to the driving test results, it has been confirmed that quick acceleration response was obtained without any shaking vibration, and the usefulness of the proposed control approach is confirmed","arnumber":"4108050","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Development of the Shaking Vibration Control for Electric Vehicles]]>","partnum":"4108050","pubtitle":"SICE-ICASE, 2006.

The limitations of current technologies are that they are individually inadequate to fully achieve mitigation objectives. Visual monitoring, passive location, high frequency active sonar, and radar all have their inherent limitations such as weather conditions, a necessity for vocalizations, maximum detection range, and sea state limitations. Therefore, there is a need for all the sources of information related to the detection and classification of marine mammals to be fused and to operate in real-time in order to provide a robust protection, assessment, and research system. The other IMPAS direction is concentrated on the design and development of the active sonar modality representing just one component of the global system. The active sonar was designed, built and tested during the Marine Mammal Active Sonar Test (MAST 04), producing whale detections and whale tracks. The experiment was conducted in January 2004 off the coast of California. One of the objectives is to distinguish whale backscattered responses from the ones generated by the environmental clutter in a waveguide. Furthermore, it aims to identify and analyze the target signature features that are necessary for enhanced active sonar detection and classification of marine mammals. Over the years there have been very few documented attempts to capture and analyze the backscattering response of whales using an active sonar system. Nevertheless, whales, mostly owing to their size, their motion, and the aspect dependence of their backscattered field, possess desirable properties that help distinguishing their scattered response from clutter and other environment related false alarms. As an initial step, data collected during the MAST04 - - experiment is presented, and gray whale target strength measurements are obtained. Results are compared to the previously published whale target strengths. Additionally, an investigation is conducted in an effort to provide whale feature identification points suitable for automated detection and classification, as means of relating gray whale active acoustic signatures to their inherent characteristics and their motion.

High grade heat sources used to drive mechanical conversion systems suffer from losses of 30-40% due to friction and fluid losses, as well as venting as much as 40% of the energy as waste heat. System complexity and cost is also driven by conversion mechanisms. Direct conversion of part or all of the heat to electrical energy could be part of an overall efficiency improvement strategy. The direct conversion mechanism should not only be efficient, but also inexpensive, compact, and low maintenance. Potential applications range from high temperature small engine designs to nuclear power direct converters. Thermionic energy converters (TECs) can meet many of these criteria. A TEC comprises a small vacuum gap (~10 microns) between a thermionic emitting electrode and a collector, sometimes with a fill gas to neutralize some of the space charge. TECs can operate at high temperatures approaching the adiabatic combustion temperature of most hydrocarbon fuels or the core temperature of a nuclear reactor, and hence have a high Carnot efficiency. They have no moving parts, and use electrons in a vacuum or low pressure gap as the working fluid, eliminating friction and working fluid losses and associated complicated parts and maintenance. Current TEC performance is constrained by the space charge limited current within the gap. The transmitted current can be increased using neutralizing plasma, but the current required to ionize the background gas reduces the power output of the TEC by about 50%. In this work, a one-dimensional model of a TEC using argon gas is developed. The model includes self consistent space charge effects, kinetic effects, impact ionization of the background gas, and an external circuit including the external load and impact on the electron transport in the gap via the surface charge. The model is implemented in the one dimensional particle-in-cell code, XPDP1 and compared with theoretical predictions","arnumber":"1707208","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[A self-consistent computational model for a thermionic energy convertor*]]>","partnum":"1707208","pubtitle":"Plasma Science, 2006.

Nanoparticles of various materials are building blocks and important constituents of ceramics and metal composites, pharmaceutical and food products, energy related products such as solid fuels and batteries, and electronics related products. The ability to manipulate the surface properties of these particles through deposition of one or more materials can greatly enhance their applicability. In this work, we discuss a low-pressure, nonequilibrium plasma process for deposition on the surface of nanoparticles. Low-pressure plasmas offer several advantages as compared to more traditional approaches. The particles are negatively charged, which prevents their agglomeration. Further, operating at room temperatures opens the possibility of coating a larger variety of materials. An overview of the experimental study is presented; however, the main thrust of the work is on theoretical modeling and numerical simulation. The modeling approach takes into account various phenomena including plasma particle distribution, nanoparticle dynamics, species transport and chemical reactions leading to the surface deposition. The plasma modeling is conducted via both particle-in-cell (PIC) method and 'fluid' transport equations for ions and electrons. Whereas the PIC approach is mainly limited to a single nanoparticle, due to excessive computational cost, it is able to provide a detailed fundamental understanding of the charging and shielding process. For practical purposes, the method of choice is via the solution of the 'fluid' transport equations augmented by an ionization model. The nanoparticle dynamics is modeled by considering a variety of forces acting on the particle. These include gravitational, electric, ion drag, and neutral drag forces. The effect of an external magnetic field on the trapping of nanoparticles in the plasma sheath is also discussed. It is shown that, for the same reactor pressure, larger particles can be trapped in the sheath by- application of an external magnetic field. This information could play a critical role in the design of low-pressure reactors which operate based on particle trapping. Finally, the chemical reaction modeling is discussed by considering a CH<sub>4<\/sub>\/H<sub>2<\/sub> plasma. The reaction model considers neutral species (CH<sub>4<\/sub> and H<sub>2<\/sub>) introduced in the reactor, along with positive ions, radicals (which are the species that contribute to the growth of the nanoparticle surface) and other neutral molecules produced by reaction of the above. The 20 species in the reaction pool, plus electrons, constitute a reaction network, consisting of 31 reactions that accounts for ionization and dissociation reactions.","arnumber":"4198766","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Low-Pressure Plasma Process for Nanoparticle Coating]]>","partnum":"4198766","pubtitle":"Plasma Science, 2005.

With advancement of bionanotechnology and quantitative medical research, the potential application of biomimetic systems is highly promising. In this paper we review the current status of biomimetic microelectronic systems and challenging issues in basic interface between electrodes and neuronal network, laboratory on a chip (LoC), and generation of power for implantable devices. For laboratory-on-a-chip (LoC), we examine a new way of detecting and sensing molecules on a chip with single molecule\/particle sensitivity by fusing integrated optics with microfluidics, based on integrated hollow-core antiresonant reflecting optical waveguides (ARROW) waveguides. With multilayer dielectric confinement, the light is guided through hollow channels with cross sections of a few microns squared. We have demonstrated efficient light guiding in liquid-core ARROWs, single-molecule fluorescence sensitivity in fully planar beam geometry, surface-enhanced Raman scattering, fluorescence from live ribosomes in buffer solution, and electrical fluorescence control by applying a voltage between fluidic reservoirs connected to the waveguide channels.

The conventional car may not meet future requirements regarding noise, emissions and energy consumption. There is a distinct lack of short-term alternative solutions that meet consumer requirements and have a potential for mass production. Furthermore, the internal combustion engine has been developed over 100 years and there may be some risk that the automotive companies choose to invest into the \"wrong\" alternative. However, industry has to accept some responsibility for providing future solutions for the products they introduced and created the demand for in first place. Starting with a vision several years ago, Japanese car companies have now taken the lead with certain types of hybrid electric vehicles. These vehicles exhibit significantly reduced energy consumption, noise emission, exhaust emissions, and yet also have improved comfort and performance. They now thrive in the USA with seemingly unexpected popularity due to rocketing oil prices and increasing awareness of the risk of oil dependency. Many car companies now follow this lead. However, there are a vast variety of possible hybrid drivetrain configurations. Modelling and simulation can help in the development and assessment of future drivetrain solutions. This paper focuses on this task using a commercially available modelling and simulation package. A drivetrain design is developed going through some initial considerations based on vehicle performance criteria that take into account consumer expectations and operational\/regulatory\/environmental factors. Based on simulation studies the drive train components are identified, mostly from the available range. Finally, a computer simulation is used to assess the performance of the vehicle. The result of these investigations is a series hybrid electric vehicle that is recharged- - from the mains. The fuel consumption is four times better than that of a comparable car, but vehicle mass and cost have not increased significantly. The driving range of this vehicle is not limited by battery capacity. Such a vehicle can meet consumer expectations as well as environmental requirements with added driver comfort. Still being low-cost, it provides the potential for mass-production thus reducing overall impacts on the environment","arnumber":"4211343","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[System Modeling and Simulation as a Tool for Developing a Vision for Future Hybrid Electric Vehicle Drivetrain Configurations]]>","partnum":"4211343","pubtitle":"Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference, 2006.

Therefore, a two stage approach (ZVT boost converter followed by LCL SRC with capacitive output filter) will be studied in the future.","arnumber":"4685381","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[A comparison of soft-switched DC-to-DC converters for electrolyser application]]>","partnum":"4685381","pubtitle":"Power Electronics, 2006.

Public and private investment in key emerging technologies continues to be strong globally even in the midst of modest economic growth expectations and concerns about the growing U.S. budget deficit. Political concerns over the need to develop alternative energy sources and the war in Iraq have ensured public funding would be available. Such funding, especially for technologies that demand large amount of blue-sky and continued R&amp;D spending, helps to reduce investment risk for the private sector. This sharing the burden of commercializing new technologies is vital in order for the private sector to continue to attempt to develop commercial applications and new growth markets. It is expected that both robotics and energy sectors would continue to growth and serve as two of the key markets in the 21st century. In order for the above to experience this expected growth, it is necessary for researchers to develop breakthroughs in micro\/MEMS and nanotechnology - i.e. \"small tech.\" Public funding for small tech has experienced tremendous increases over the past decade as not only major industrialized countries have developed extensive small tech programs but even emerging markets have attempted to stake a competitive claim in key niche areas. Small tech is believed to be the key enabler to assist in the sudden, exponential expansion in the robotics and energy industries, and a great deal of R&amp;D and commercialization in small tech is directly related to both. The US and Japan have provided the bulk of funding for all of the above with a number of countries playing key supporting roles. Though a great deal of U.S. public research and development is currently focused on military applications, a great deal of innovation would eventually find its way to the private sector and be commercialized. In Japan, much public funding is tied to private sector commercialization efforts and companies have devoted more R&amp;D spending than their American- - counterparts. For example, Japan is the global leader in public and private sector investment in nanotechnology, leads in the commercialization of robotics and the Japanese automobile industry leads the world in the manufacture and sales of hybrid next generation automobiles which utilize fuel cells.

A small engine which is used to supply power approximately equal to the average load power is coaxially configured with an induction motor with an external rotor which is used to supply the peaking power required by the required peaking load of vehicle. The motor can also absorb the excess power of the engine while the load power is less than the peak power. The excess power will be used to charge the vehicular battery pack to keep state of charge (SOC) of the battery pack as the regenerative braking power. With the electrically assist principle, a controller for hybrid ISG assemble has been developed, and a fuzzy logic control strategy used to control the ISG system and motor was discussed. The control system for hybrid propulsion system is responsible for collecting information relative to vehicle and judges the load rate of engine and motor, and finally decides the operating state and rate of power distribution between engine and motor. By optimizing the system efficiency and minimizing fuel consumption and emission, the optimal performance will be reached. Electronics control unit (ECU) of hybrid propulsion system controls ECUs of engine, motor and automatic mechanics transmission (AMT), and monitors the state of battery management system (BMS), they communicate with each other and exchange information by control area network (CAN) bus interface. In order to accelerate developing process of hybrid propulsion system, a rapid developing system called on-line debugging and programming software has been developed. This system runs in PC, and communicates with the ECU of hybrid propulsion system by serial communication interface (SCI) RS232, but the ECU of hybrid propulsion system communicates with the ECUs of engine, AMT, BMS and accessory by CAN bus. This system mainly includes the following functions: (1) field test and bench test, (2) parameter calibration, (3) on-ling debugging for HEV, AMT and CAN bus, (4) vehicle dynamics simulation, (5) on-line programming, (6) troubleshooting etc. Those functions may achieve the rapid development on hardware and software of control system for hybrid propulsion system. In addition, the on-line debugging - and programming system can monitor state information of overall system and modify parametric maps or update control program onboard by the on-line debugging or programming function. Based on the on-line debugging software package developed by our group at HUBEI automotive industries institute, the hybrid ISG assemble and its controller have been designed.

Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) have been considered a viable option towards achieving these goals. Ford Motor Company developed a full hybrid electric vehicle with an e-CVT (electronically controlled continuously variable transmission) or power-split hybrid powertrain with an integrated motor and generator. The power-split hybrid system uses planetary gear sets to connect an engine, a generator, and a motor. This HEV powertrain exhibits great potential to improve fuel economy by enabling the engine to operate at its most efficient region independent of the vehicle speed. To achieve fuel economy improvements of the power-split hybrid system, high-voltage (HV) battery power management is critical. To control actual HV battery power in such vehicles, a sophisticated control system is essential which controls engine power and thereby engine speed to achieve the desired HV battery maintenance power. Conventional approaches use proportional-integral (PI) control systems to control the actual HV battery power in power-split hybrid system, which can sometimes result in either overshoots of engine speed and power or degraded response and settling times due to the nonlinearity of the power-split hybrid system. Such an overshoot is often objectionable to customers, which see engine speed overshoots as disconnect between the driver's request and the engine response. This issue comes from the fact that a complete high fidelity mathematical model for the power-split HEV system along with the environmental effects cannot be accurately modeled inside the controller. Therefore, a controller adaptable to nonlinear behavior and not requiring detailed knowledge of mathematical model of the plant is required to address such issues. Fuzzy control approaches can provide a way to cope with the limitations of the conventional controllers. We have developed a fu- zzy control approach with minimal rules to intelligently control engine power and speed behavior in a powersplit HEV. This approach uses selective minimal rule-based fuzzy gain-scheduling to determine appropriate gains for the PI controller based on the system's operating conditions. The improvements result in the reduction of the overshoots without compromising system's response and settling times in comparison with the conventional linear PI controller. This paper describes the power-split hybrid vehicle's powertrain system and key subsystems. It also describes minimal rule-based fuzzy gain-scheduling PI controller and the formulation of minimal fuzzy rules required to achieve the desired behavior. This minimal rule-based fuzzy controller was implemented in a Ford Escape hybrid vehicle and was evaluated in the vehicle test environment for a comparative analysis of the results to show its effectiveness. The results clearly demonstrate that the designed minimal rule based fuzzy gains scheduling controller is capable of significantly improving the engine speed and power behavior in a power-split HEV without compromising the system's response and settling times","arnumber":"4216816","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Rule-Based Fuzzy Gain-Scheduling PI Controller to Improve Engine Speed and Power Behavior in a Power-split Hybrid Electric Vehicle]]>","partnum":"4216816","pubtitle":"Fuzzy Information Processing Society, 2006.

The power-split hybrid consists of two powertrains; an engine and an electric drive system. This powertrain provides a great potential to improve fuel economy in part due to its ability to operate engine at efficient regions independent of the vehicle speed. The engine speed determination in such a system depends on the desired high voltage (HV) battery power and the driver demand (driver torque\/power request). Clearly, in order to control HV battery power to a desired power, a sophisticated controls system is essential which controls engine power to achieve the desired HV battery power. The desired engine power in turn determines the desired engine speed. It is essential that engine speed operation is smooth and stable with an acceptable response. Use of a classical proportional-integral (PI) based control system to control HV battery power is limited due to the nonlinear behavior of the powertrain, and results either in an undesired engine speed stability behavior under certain driving conditions or degraded response time. This paper presents a new nonlinear controls scheme based on a fuzzy controller to resolve the undesired engine speed behavior while achieving desired engine speed response and improved high-voltage battery power controls.

The rotating inertia of these components is important in vehicle performance analyses. However, in many studies, the rotating inertias are typically lumped into an equivalent inertial mass to simplify the analysis, making it difficult to investigate the effect of those components and losses for vehicle energy use. In this study, a backward-tracking model from the wheels and tires to the power source (battery or fuel cell) is developed to estimate the effect of rotating inertias for each component during propulsion and regenerative braking of a vehicle. This paper presents the effect of rotating inertias on the power and energy for propulsion and regenerative braking for two-wheel drive (either front or rear) and all-wheel drive (AWD) cases. On-road driving and dynamometer tests are different since only one axle (two wheels) is rotating in the latter case, instead of two axles (four wheels). The differences between an on-road test and a dynamometer test are estimated using the developed model. The results show that the rotating inertias can contribute a significant fraction (8-13 %) of the energy recovered during deceleration due to the relatively lower losses of rotating components compared to vehicle inertia, where a large fraction is dissipated in friction braking. In a dynamometer test, the amount of energy captured from available energy in wheel\/tire assemblies is slightly less than that of the AWD case in on-road test. The total regenerative brake energy capture is significantly higher (>70 %) for a FWD vehicle on a dynamometer compared to an on-road case. The rest of inertial energy is lost by inefficiencies in components, regenerative brake fraction, and friction braking on the un-driven axle.","arnumber":"1554575","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Rotating inertia impact on propulsion and regenerative braking for electric motor driven vehicles]]>","partnum":"1554575","pubtitle":"Vehicle Power and Propulsion, 2005 IEEE Conference","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1554575","epage":"","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1554575&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"879","punumber":"10416","publicationid":"1554575","doi":"10.1109\/VPPC.2005.1554575"},{"isbn":"0-7695-2496-6","py":"2005","spage":"160","abstract":"The operational envelope of gas turbine engines such as employed in the Army Blackhawk helicopter is constrained by the stability limit of the compression system. Stall control technologies developed at the ARL Vehicle Technology Directorate and NASA Glenn Research Center to improve the stable operating range of compressors lack fundamental understanding beneficial to design guidance. Improved understanding of the stall inception process and how stall control technologies mitigate such will provide compressors with increased tolerance to stall, thereby expanding the operational envelope of military gas turbine engines. To provide improved understanding, time accurate CFD simulations are being computed at full-scale actual engine conditions using the parallel solver, TURBO, developed at Mississippi State University (MSU) with support from NASA, DoD, and industry. As a compressor nears stall the flow field is no longer periodic from passage to passage, therefore full-annulus (i.e., all blade passages of every blade row) must be computed. For a typical multistage compressor this becomes a formidable computational challenge requiring access to massively parallel machines in order to meet the computational and memory demands of the problem. Unsteady full-annulus simulations of both a single stage axial and centrifugal compressor, for which detailed experimental data are available, provide validation of the TURBO code for subsequent use in predicting the stall inception processes in an axicentrifugal multistage compressor employed in the Army Blackhawk helicopter. The simulations show the inception of stall and subsequent evolution into a fully developed stall cell. Also, shown are the predictions of range extension with stall control and comparison to measurements. Finally, a status of the unsteady fullannulus simulations of the compression system components of the U.S. Army Helicopter Gas Turbine Engine is presented. All military and commercial gas turbine engine systems can benefit from the proposed work. In the future, this work could lead to new gas turbine engine designs with resistance to compressor stall and thus improved combat capability. This work will provide the first-ever 3-dimensional viscous time-accurate simulation of the stall inception process i- n a multistage compressor, providing insight into the causal link between compressor blade design parameters and the stable operating limit, which will be used to guide new design practices leading to compressor designs with increased tolerance to stall.

The UNH Open Ocean Aquaculture demonstration project is working on its third and most ambitious automated, remote feeding buoy for offshore aquaculture operations. A central part of the feeders is a computer and software in the feed buoy, which controls and monitors the operations. This onboard processor has a large variety of tasks. It must start the generator in time for scheduled large power drain activities such as powering lights in the submerged fish cages to delay sexual maturation, and the feeding operations with its pumps, feed augers, feed dosers, etc. Also, the system must monitor of the status of each of these activity as they are taking place. This includes seeing that the generator started properly, that power is on the generator's power bus, and then switching it to the main system power bus. When activities such as feeding are taking place, the system must monitor the quantity of feed in the feed hopper, the rate that the feed is being delivered to the feed hose, and the pressure in the feed hose (to catch any blockages). The system also has a series of critical points that it monitors, such as any water in the buoy, the backup battery voltage, the rate of charge by any solar and wind power system and any critical problems with feeding or other activities. The system is programmed to respond to any problems, such as emergency shut down of the generator should it get too hot, the oil pressure too low, and the fuel level gets low. It will also terminate any feeding activity if the pressure in the feed hose rises indicating blockage. If water is detected in the buoy, indicating a leakage in the buoy itself or from one of the subsystems, the system sends an alert to shore as well as turns off any critical activities and making sure that all bilge pumps are active. The programmed activities are controlled b- - y a series of files stored on compact flash in the computer. The system checks each hour to see if an activity is scheduled, then reads another control file (listed in the activities timing file) that will control the details of that activity. If it is feeding time, then it will read the feeding file specified which will tell how fast to feed, for what duration, and what sequence of pumps to use during the feeding process. By referring to different feeding control files, several feeding schedules can be run during one day, or on a weekly cycle. A feeding cycle may include putting a small amount of feed in the hose, then turning on a pump to wash it down to the fish cage, then waiting a little time for the fish to eat that food, and repeating the operation a number of times again. These systems are evolving with the third feed buoy, and lessons learned from the first two are being incorporated into the next","arnumber":"4098928","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Aquaculture Feed Buoy Control - Part 1: System Controller]]>","partnum":"4098928","pubtitle":"OCEANS 2006","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4098928","epage":"6","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4098928&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"891","punumber":"4098824","publicationid":"4098928","doi":"10.1109\/OCEANS.2006.307132"},{"isbn":"978-1-4244-3450-3","py":"2006","spage":"360","abstract":"This paper presents simulation and real time implementation of fuzzy logic controller for a high frequency soft-switched DC-DC converter for applications especially in distributed energy generation systems like solar systems, vertical axis aero-generator and fuel-cell power systems.

The use of a representative volume allows us to make predictions about the autocorrelation function of quasars. To predict the evolution of black hole growth and the associated quasar luminosity, we track mergers of dark matter halos, a process which is known to predict the luminosity function of quasars at high redshift with great accuracy. The heating processes are then modelled under the assumption that matter is consumed at the Eddington rate for a predicted dynamical time. By following the hydrodynamic evolution of the gas fuelling the growth of quasars, we are able to examine whether we reproduce the \"anti-hierarchical\" turn-off in the luminosity function for quasars. While we predict the correlation function with great accuracy, the outflows in our simulations, for an equivalent efficiency, have a smaller impact on the luminosity function than in a similar semi-analytic model.

A revolutionary concept for disrupting the formation of tornadoes in a thunderstorm is proposed for evaluation. Beamed microwave energy from a satellite could heat cold rainy downdrafts to alter convective forces in the storm cell. Such a satellite is termed a thunderstorm solar power satellite (TSPS). The TSPS is based on Space Solar Power Program (SSP) concepts and technology. Other weather modification ideas are examined to relate critical issues to the TSPS. When weather modification is a subject, cloud seeding is the usual paradigm that is examined. This process has been tried for over fifty years and it still does not produce unquestionable results. Steering hurricanes is a subject of computer simulations and is early stage of analysis. It is believed that the TSPS concept merits additional analysis, numerical simulation and demonstration testing","arnumber":"1656145","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Thunderstorm solar power satellite-issues dealing with weather modification]]>","partnum":"1656145","pubtitle":"Aerospace Conference, 2006 IEEE","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1656145","epage":"","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1656145&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"896","punumber":"11012","publicationid":"1656145","doi":"10.1109\/AERO.2006.1656145"},{"isbn":"0-7803-9252-3","py":"2005","spage":"6 pp.","abstract":"This paper proposes a new configuration of 36-pulse voltage source converter for STATCOM application, composed of two 6-pulse bridges and a pulse-interleaving auxiliary circuit.

Maintenance cost of this aircraft system is typically high due to the large damaging forces directed through these components. Consequently, monitoring the health of the drive train can potentially enhance flight safety and reduce operating costs. Health and usage management systems (HUMS) monitor the drive train by using accelerometers to measure component vibration. Algorithms process the time domain vibration data into various condition indicators (CI), which are used to determine component health via thresholding. For the rotating machinery, a standard set of CI are shaft order one, two and three (i.e. 1, 2 or 3 times the shaft RPM). Shaft order one (SOI) is indicative of an unbalance, where as higher shaft order can be used to detect a bent shaft or misalignment condition. The magnitude of the shaft orders sometimes have maximum allowable values set by the manufacture. At other times, some method is used to set thresholds, and maintenance is recommended when that vibration exceeds that threshold. In this paper, we present evidence that the distribution of the magnitude vibration is Rayleigh for nominal (health components) and the Rice for components that are damaged. A model for shaft magnitude is used which describes the Rayleigh distribution. It is shown that the Rice distribution is the general case of the Rayleigh distribution when the component has nonzero centrality (e.g. an imbalance). Threshold setting procedures for the Rayleigh distribution are given for anomaly detection (e.g. component is no longer normal) and for failure detection (component is damaged) and compared to Gaussian model. Finally, examples are given against real world conditions. The Rayleigh and Rice distribution are beneficial for diagnostics and prognostics as it measures non-centrality (imbalance) and variance (stiffne- - ss) in shaft vibration better than Gaussian models. We feel that use of this class of non-Gaussian distributions may allow accurate calculation of useful life remaining because it is sensitive to changes in shaft stiffness that is a precursor to component failure","arnumber":"1656102","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Use of non-Gaussian distribution for analysis of shaft components]]>","partnum":"1656102","pubtitle":"Aerospace Conference, 2006 IEEE","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1656102","epage":"","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1656102&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"902","punumber":"11012","publicationid":"1656102","doi":"10.1109\/AERO.2006.1656102"},{"isbn":"1-4244-0332-4","py":"2006","spage":"1778","abstract":"In this paper, we have investigated how the optimization methods can be used to deal with plant uncertainty.

This paper presents an agent-based control framework for distributed energy resources microgrids. The features of agent technology are first discussed. An agent-based control framework for DER microgrids is then presented. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed agent- based control framework, simulation studies have been performed on a dc distributed energy system that can be used in a microgrid as a modular power generation unit.

Solutions to several implementation barriers, such as awareness of thermal and electrical energy systems, long term planning, system balancing for size and location, national CHP policy and a multiple-benefits business case, are needed for more market penetration of efficient cogeneration and district energy systems into our communities and industries.","arnumber":"4057309","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[High Efficiency Combined Heat and Power Solutions]]>","partnum":"4057309","pubtitle":"EIC Climate Change Technology, 2006 IEEE","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4057309","epage":"11","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4057309&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"915","punumber":"4057290","publicationid":"4057309","doi":"10.1109\/EICCCC.2006.277179"},{"isbn":"1-4244-0548-3","py":"2006","spage":"1","abstract":"The single-phase and three-phase renewable power generation system for distributed power applications are presented in the paper.

It argues that markets have huge power to transform themselves but their \"will\" to do so is heavily conditioned by the nature, magnitude and duration of the value which is perceived, won or lost by those involved in and impacted by that transformation. For energy efficiency and low carbon technologies, there is a gap between the perception of their value by individuals and by society. So far as mitigating (and adapting to) climate change is concerned, there is a global imperative to achieve the societal good of a low carbon economy. The more time we spend not making the transition, the harder it will be for future generations and the more disruptive will be the climate change induced conditions they will face. Many Governments have recognised this imperative and have devised a range of regulatory, fiscal and market interventions to tackle and mitigate climate change. Ever since the Rio Summit in 1992, the UK Government has been among the leading protagonists for action. Its first climate change programme, launched in November 2000, featured new policies and measures designed to achieve reductions in our carbon dioxide emissions. A novel, groundbreaking element in the UK's climate change programme is the Carbon Trust - an independent, business led, Government backed company set up in March 2001. The Carbon Trust's objective is \"to accelerate the transition to a low carbon economy by helping organisations reduce their carbon emissions and develop commercial low carbon technologies\".This paper discusses low carbon technology innovation and commercialisation. It describes the Carbon Trust's roles: (a) to reduce carbon emissions now, using today's know how; (b) to help develop and commercialise new and emerging energy efficiency and low c- - arbon technologies; and (c) to understand the impacts of climate change and help inform the development of Governmental and corporate policies and measures to accelerate the transition to a low carbon economy. It also discusses the nature of innovation and commercialisation; how the Carbon Trust is working to understand it better; and how we have gone about applying our understanding in practice.","arnumber":"4057361","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Devising and implementing incentives for low carbon technology innovation and commercialisation - a perspective drawn from Carbon Trust experience]]>","partnum":"4057361","pubtitle":"EIC Climate Change Technology, 2006 IEEE","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4057361","epage":"7","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4057361&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"925","punumber":"4057290","publicationid":"4057361","doi":"10.1109\/EICCCC.2006.277231"},{"isbn":"978-5-93208-034-4","py":"2005","spage":"1","abstract":"The main objective of this paper is to present the development of microsource modelling and the definition of control strategies to be adopted to evaluate the feasibility of operation of a microgrid when it becomes isolated.

A new two-step procedure is proposed. In the first step, all new lines are added to the network and an expectation planning model is presented. Stochastic simulation and genetic algorithm are applied to obtain the optimal ratings of DG units. In the second step, a heuristic successive backward algorithm based on a sensitivity index is presented. The sensitivity index is defined as the system capacity reserve decrease by the total investment cost of the line to be removed. According to the index, the redundant lines in the network can be eliminated.

Such a system has been developed and successfully tested at the Hydrogen Research Institute (HRI).

The stored hydrogen represents a long-term ecological and transportable form of energy. The renewable energy (RE) system components have substantially different voltage-current characteristics and their operation must be well understood and coordinated to allow an optimal power management in the system. Wind turbine generator, DC-DC buck converter and electrolyzer play key roles in the hydrogen production process. Accurate knowing of operating characteristics of these components is necessary to develop an effective power flow control for the hydrogen production. This paper investigates operational characteristics of the wind turbine, the electrolyzer and the buck converter in order to develop an energy management strategy that will increase the hydrogen production efficiency in the RE system. Wind turbine model is developed and simulation results are compared with experimental measurements. The electrolyzer is characterized and its optimal operating range is defined. The multiphase control principle of the designed buck converter is presented and the efficiency curve is provided.

A broad variety of applications has been investigated, from Earth to orbit, orbit to Earth, in-orbit and planetary ones, such as for Moon and Mars missions. The question of whether to use laser or microwave technology has been widely discussed. Beaming energy to spacecraft could provide an important space mission-economic potential. It promises significant reduction in the cost of access to space and increases the mission capabilities for in-space systems. For the future enhancement of International Space Station (ISS) capabilities and operational efficiency, the use of WPT technology has become part of technology research planning. An outlook in terms of future wireless power perspectives is given. The technology development philosophy as conceived at EADS-Space Transportation is described and includes main system demonstration missions. These demonstrations represent milestones in terms of technical capability verification on the way to solar power platforms in space. Ground test objectives, the definition, design and performance of a wireless power transmission system and the demonstration of the basic principles of power transmission and target acquisition, pointing and tracking are covered.

Many of the high power medium voltage electrical loads must operate during unloading and loading of the docked ships. At the same time environment protection regulations in many sea ports (California's largest ports are examples of the most restrictive requirements) do not allow ships to operate their prime movers inside the ports. Many ships operators and port authorities are struggling with the absence of appropriate standards and specifications for interconnecting the ship service loads to on-shore power distribution systems. The intent of this paper is first to review the theory, practice and existing interconnection standards and then to outline what can be done to achieve secure, reliable, safe and cost effective operation of the ship service toads inside international ports.

The connection may only be for a short transfer time of a few seconds during paralleling for periodic testing. The power rating of an ICG is not important when considering protective relays required, because several small engine generators of 100 kW or a single larger ICG of 10.0 MW could form an island. Thus, all ICG connected to an electric power system usually are required to have the same protection in place at their point of common coupling. This paper elaborates on the protection and its operation will prevent undesired consequences to the ICG owner, the utility and to the general public. The paper also discusses actions that take place when the utility supply is disrupted creating an islanding condition, and states reasons why protection required by regulatory agencies, local utilities and documents such as IEEE Standard 1547 \"IEEE Standard for Interconnecting Distributed Resources with Electric Power Systems\" are required of an individual ICG.

This paper investigates the benefits including reduced losses, shifting reactive power flow to real power flow, and increased transfer capability. These benefits are illustrated with a simple two-bus model and then presented with a more complicated model using optimal power flow. Tests are conducted on a system with seven buses in two areas. These simulations show that the economic benefits can be significant, if compared with capacity payment to central generators or power factor penalties applied to utilities.

It consists of two single-phase full-bridge converters with the latest trench-gate Si-IGBTs and a 20-kHz transformer with a nano-crystalline soft-magnetic material core and litz wires. The transformer plays an essential role in achieving galvanic isolation between the two full-bridge converters.

The connection may only be for a short transfer time of a few seconds during paralleling for periodic testing. A tendency is to look at the consequences of just their own ICG trying to serve a much larger utility load without considering that there may be other ICG connected to the same circuit. The power rating of an ICG is not important when considering protective relays required, because several small engine generators of 100 kW or a single larger ICG of 10.0 MW could form an island. Thus, all ICG connected to an electric power system usually are required to have the same protection in place at their point of common coupling. Different scenarios of islanding operation are presented, such as: is it necessary to enforce separation of loads that are outside the premises of the owner of the energy source, while retaining service to loads within the owner's premises, or is it acceptable to simply shut down the ICG until the grid can be restored? A basic step in addressing islanding protection is to have a clear expectation of what is supposed to happen when an island is created. This paper elaborates on the proper required protection and how its operation will prevent undesired consequences to the ICG owner, the utility and to the general public. The paper also discusses actions that take place when the utility supply is disrupted creating an islanding condition, and states reasons why protection required by regulatory agencies, local utilities and documents such as IEEE Standard 1547 \"IEEE standard for interconnecting distributed resources with electric power systems\" are required of an individual ICG. Consequences of not having the protection in place can permit damage to the generator and\/or its prime mover, plus be a hazard to public safety. Examples of th- ese consequences are given. This paper will provide a clearer understanding to ICG owners of why they are required to have specified protective equipment in place","arnumber":"1436355","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Application of islanding protection for industrial & commercial generators a working group report]]>","partnum":"1436355","pubtitle":"Industrial and Commercial Power Systems Technical Conference, 2005 IEEE","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1436355","epage":"51","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1436355&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"955","punumber":"9813","publicationid":"1436355","doi":"10.1109\/ICPS.2005.1436355"},{"isbn":"0-7803-9716-9","py":"2006","spage":"1","abstract":"This paper describes a bi-directional isolated dc\/dc converter considered as a core circuit of 3.3-kV\/6.6-kV high-power-density power conversion systems in the next generation.

It is difficult to diagnose a multilevel-inverter drive (MLID) system using a mathematical model because MLID systems consist of many switching devices and their system complexity has a nonlinear factor. Therefore, a neural network (NN) classification is applied to the fault diagnosis of a MLID system. Multilayer perceptron networks are used to identify the type and location of occurring faults. The principal component analysis (PCA) is utilized in the feature extraction process to reduce the NN input size. A lower dimensional input space will also usually reduce the time necessary to train a NN, and the reduced noise may improve the mapping performance. The output phase voltage of a MLID can be used to diagnose the faults and their locations. The reconfiguration technique is also proposed. The effects of using the proposed reconfiguration technique at high modulation index are addressed. The proposed system is validated with experimental results.

While often there is a concern that the DG will have an adverse effect on the power system, the presence of an alternative source provides an opportunity to use the capabilities of the source to enhance and support the system. Through advanced control of the DG, power system personnel may investigate how changing the DG settings prior to planned switching or major load changes may reduce transient impacts on the system. Additionally the DG provides an opportunity to investigate the feature of intentional islanding during a major event.

In order to utilize the present utility grid infrastructure for power transmission and distribution, grid connected dc-to-ac inverters are needed for solar power generation. However, previously proposed voltage source inverters with a two-power-stage structure or a cascaded structure increase the circuit complexity, power losses, and system cost. In addition, conventional maximum power point tracking (MPPT) methods usually need power calculation and complex logic judgment, so expensive multipliers and\/or microprocessors are needed. This leads to high inverter capital cost, which becomes a major barrier for the wide use of solar power generation. A cost-effective MPPT method integrated within the one-cycle control (OCC) core is proposed in this paper. When integrated with a three-phase boost type inverter, the proposed method tracks MPP with good precision, and solar power is converted into three-phase ac power with a single power stage. There is no power calculation in the controller, which yields a simple and cost-effective solution. Experiments have been carried out with a photovoltaic source to verify good performance","arnumber":"4025332","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[A Cost-effective Three-phase Grid-connected Inverter with Maximum Power Point Tracking]]>","partnum":"4025332","pubtitle":"Industry Applications Conference, 2006. 41st IAS Annual Meeting.

This paper investigates new ideas for membrane reactors such as the development of new catalytic films, for improved interaction between the reaction and separation zones. Current membrane reactors utilise a packed bed of catalyst within the membrane tube, utilising a large volume of catalyst to drive reaction. This is still inefficient and provides only limited benefits over conventional WGS reactors. New reactor configurations look to optimise the interactive effects between reaction and separation to provide improved operation. In this paper, thin film catalysts were produced using dip coating and spray coating techniques. This technique produced catalyst coatings with good thickness, though the abrasion strength of the dip coated catalyst was quite low. The catalyst was tested in a packed bed reactor for temperature activity at low temperatures and catalyst activity at varying levels of excess water","arnumber":"4143446","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Silica membrane reactors for hydrogen production from water gas shift]]>","partnum":"4143446","pubtitle":"Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, 2006.

Seven ISRU processes were analyzed to determine mass, power and propellant storage volume requirements. The major elements of each process include CO<sub>2<\/sub> acquisition, chemical conversion, and storage of propellants. Based on two figures of merit [(a) the ratio of the mass of propellants that must be brought from Earth in a non-ISRU mission to the mass of the ISRU system, tanks and feedstocks that must be brought from Earth for a ISRU mission, and (b) the mission mass in LEO saved by use of ISRU] the most attractive process (by far) is one where indigenous Mars water is accessible and this is processed via Sabarier\/electrolysis to methane and oxygen. These processes are technically relatively mature. Other processes with positive leverage involve reverse water gas shift and solid oxide electrolysis. These processes would be appropriate if accessible water is not available on Mars. However the technologies involved are still immature. Processes that require storage of large amounts of hydrogen were deemed infeasible because of power, volume and mass considerations. The critical interfacial issues with Mars are finding accessible sources of water and acquisition of CO<sub>2<\/sub> from the atmosphere. A technology development and demonstration program is proposed that hinges heavily on the search for accessible water. A roadmap summarizes the future steps needed to implement ISRU in the human mission architecture.","arnumber":"1559325","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Preliminary system analysis of in situ resource utilization for Mars human exploration]]>","partnum":"1559325","pubtitle":"Aerospace Conference, 2005 IEEE","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1559325","epage":"338","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1559325&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"979","punumber":"10432","publicationid":"1559325","doi":"10.1109\/AERO.2005.1559325"},{"isbn":"1-4244-0227-1","py":"2006","spage":"193","abstract":"The paper presents new models of DC-DC converters.

This paper discusses the issues associated with bringing electricity to the rural population (accessibility), providing an adequate supply of reliable power (availability), and providing power safety, with minimal impact on ecosystems and the environment (acceptability). All three factors must be satisfied if electricity is to have a significant effect on local economy and quality of life. The paper describes the results of an analysis indicating that an electric energy level of 1,000 kWh per person is needed to achieve electric services such as lighting, entertainment, refrigeration, public health, clean water, and basic education. The paper also describes the technologies needed to generate the needed power and transmit the electricity from the point of generation to the end use location. Africa has abundant supplies of indigenous primary energy resources such as coal, especially in South Africa, hydropower, wind, and solar resources. These supplies, along with uranium and imported petroleum and liquefied natural gas round out the energy supply. The analysis indicates that combining central station generation in urban areas with distributed renewable generation will provide a balanced portfolio of generation options that will be robust over a range of country-specific conditions.

When the conventional and non-conventional micro sources are combined with energy storage devices, they are called distributed resources (DR). The energy storage device of the DR provides the ride-through for the transient load demand. The DR is capable of providing reliable power supply to sensitive loads when connected in the form of a microgrid. The customer solution of UPS typically provides AC voltage to the load when the grid fails. Backup generation systems based on rotating machines may be used as an alternative to a UPS system to supply power to sensitive loads during temporary interruptions in grid power supply. However, such systems require a start-up time to deliver power, which would cause a brief interruption in the operation of sensitive loads.

This paper discusses platform design techniques for supporting these design goals through the trade-offs of sensing devices, wireless interfaces, and computation and control units. We also cover power subsystem design for supply-aware optimizations, including load\/supply matching, power defragmentation in multi-supply systems, and use of supercapacitors.

The secure operation of a power system depends on the provision of system services such as frequency stability, power balance, voltage stability or system management. The current responsibilities for these system services will be discussed in this paper taking into account German experiences using decentralized energy sources. Furthermore, some guide lines on planning and operation, which take into account the impact of this new situation as well as recent experiences in Germany, was discussed. The following topics were elaborated and described: decentralized energy management, reserve power provision, coordination with a transmission system operator (TSO); voltage stability; fault ride through and supply restoration; power balance in island operation. The description takes into account the modeling issues, the operation of the wind parks, the planning and operation of the dispersed generation and will lead to a proposal of a benchmark for the medium voltage network.

Concerning the cogenerator electric parts, the state of the art is based on an electric three-phase generator directly connected to the grid; hence the engine must deliver the requested power at the fixed speed determined by the frequency of the grid. Some potential advantages can be exploited adopting the electronic power control for the load following with the engine speed regulation.

The need to provide acceptable power quality and reliability will create a very favorable climate for the entry of distributed resources and innovative operating practices. Of all the different parts of an electric power system, customers identify closely with the distribution subsystem due to its proximity and visibility on a daily basis. Several recent developments have encouraged the entry of power generation and energy storage at the distribution level. Distributed resources (DR) is a term that encompasses both distributed generation (DG) and distributed energy storage (DS). A distributed utility will use both distributed resources and load management to achieve its goal. In addition, several compact distributed generation technologies are fast becoming economically viable. Integration of DG into an existing utility can result in several benefits. These benefits include line loss reduction, reduced environmental impacts, peak shaving, increased overall energy efficiency, relieved transmission and distribution congestion, voltage support, and deferred investments to upgrade existing generation, transmission, and distribution systems. Benefits are not limited to utility. Customers also benefit from DG in term of better quality of supply at lower cost. Among the many benefits of distributed generation is a reduced line loss. The purpose of this paper is to quantify this benefit for the simple case of a radial distribution feeder with concentrated load and distributed generator. With the introduction of DG, line loss reduction can be expected. The analysis is presented for varying locations of the distributed generator along the feeder and for varying output capacities.

The planning strategies initially considered cost-benefit analysis of distributed generation (DG). Later supporting advantages of the hybrid system including improvement of the efficiency were also considered for decision making. With increased complexities in DGs planning options along with multiple attributes to be accounted, more sophisticated techniques are needed to arrive at the correct decisions by decision makers. The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is proposed to identify the relative significance of the chosen attributes. Proper integration of different attributes can be achieved by linear additive utility function. Further, the uncertainties are accounted by statistical method like interval based multi-attribute decision making (MADM). MADM technique is applied to three cases: conventional grid, hybrid DG operation and micro-grid. The attributes considered are incremental losses, capital costs and percentage time for which demand is not served for ail cases. It is assumed that attributes are not related with each other. The proposed method is demonstrated on a sample system which is derived from a practical system. The effect of loading condition is also considered in the formulation. The results indicate that the proposed decision making technique has an ability to quantify the merits and justify new technology.

Also, the AC-side phenomenon is shown through space vector analysis to depend on the time intervals of inverter states used for reconstructing the desired inverter output voltage.

In this study, an \"empty network\" is defined as a power system in which no rotating mass is present; all generators are grid-connected via power electronic interfaces, so that the possible inertia of the generators is 'hidden' from the network. One generator creates a neat 50 Hz voltage that serves as a frequency reference for the other generators. Conventional power systems are mainly supplied by large centralized synchronous generators. These generators are connected directly to the grid so that there is a coupling between the generator rotor speed, and thus the system frequency, and the power balance in the system. Therefore, an unbalance manifests itself by an altered system frequency. In the empty network, the frequency is fixed, as it is created by a power electronic device, and an unbalance cannot be detected in the classical way. In this paper, an empty network is simulated on an RTDS (real time digital simulator). Voltage deviations are used to detect the power unbalances. Simple test systems that consist of 1,2 and 3 buses are applied, in which all generators are modeled as current sources, except for the frequency reference, which is a voltage source. A load jump is simulated to cause a power unbalance in the system.

The designed Z-source NPC inverter uses two unique X-shaped LC impedance networks connected between two isolated dc input power sources and its inverter circuitry for boosting its ac output voltage. Through the design of an appropriate pulse-width modulation (PWM) algorithm, the two impedance networks can be short-circuited sequentially (without shooting through the inverter full dc link) for implementing the \"nearest three vectors\" (NTV) modulation principle with minimized harmonic distortion and device commutations per half carrier cycle, while performing voltage-boosting. With only a slight modification to the inverter PWM algorithm and by short-circuiting the two LC impedance networks simultaneously, the designed NPC inverter, with no requirement for dead-time delay, can also be operated with completely eliminated common-mode voltage. Implementation-wise, detailed vectorial analysis interestingly shows that the same generic set of carrier-based modulation expressions can be used for controlling Z-source two-level inverter and NPC inverter with and without reduced common-mode (RCM) switching.

It is based on measuring the DC and AC components of the buffer inductor current to compensate the modulation effect from the DC side to the AC side of the CSI. Apart from reducing the harmonic content, the method can also reduce the required value of the buffer inductor. Modeling, design, and analysis of the method are given.

With the hybrid control strategy, i.e. frequency control combined with phase shift control, the converter maintains zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) throughout the low-frequency cycle, which results in reduced switching losses and EMI. However, this control strategy exhibits disappointing performance for the light load operation. By contrast, the phase shift control strategy shows higher performance and better adaptability over a wide load range. A correction look-up table for the light load operation generated from the steady-state characteristics of the converter improves the shape of the output voltage.

DG includes the application of small generators, scattered throughout a power system, to provide the electric power needed by electrical customer. Such locally distributed generation, has several merits from the viewpoint of environmental restriction and location limitations, as well as transient and voltage stability in the power system. The exact solution of the DG allocation can be obtained by a complete enumeration of all feasible combinations of sites and sizes of DGs in the network. The number of alternatives could be very large, however load flow should be performed for each feasible combination and selection of the optimized solution among these alternatives is an important task. The problem is to determine site and size of DG that minimizes the distribution power losses under the condition that number of DGs and total capacity of DGs are known. Artificial intelligence techniques have come to be most widely used tool for solving optimal DG allocation. Genetic algorithm (GA) is an efficient tool to solve optimization problems. Generally, GA's ability to find a correct solution in a variety of problems, to preserve diversity for preventing premature convergence and to improve convergence time is affected by parent selection algorithm for generating offspring. In this paper, to overcome the defects of existing simple genetic algorithm (SGA), Hereford Ranch algorithm (HRA), is applied to search optimal site and size of DG in distribution feeders.

The distributed generators are small or medium scale units connected to the low or medium voltage networks (LV or MV). Due to their low inertia for small rotating machines, these distributed generators are very sensitive to network disturbances and can cause many technical and operating issues regarding the DG stability. This paper focuses on these stability aspects taking into account the location and the clearing time of the short circuits. Various assumptions about DG coupling mode on LV and MV networks, DG regulation systems, DG rated power and interaction between DG are investigated. Influences of DG with power electronic interface on the stability are discussed. For a large distribution network with a high penetration of DG, a dynamic equivalent reduction technique is used for the study","arnumber":"1668506","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Stability Analysis for the Distribution Networks with Distributed Generation]]>","partnum":"1668506","pubtitle":"Transmission and Distribution Conference and Exhibition, 2005\/2006 IEEE PES","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1668506","epage":"294","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1668506&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"1092","punumber":"11056","publicationid":"1668506","doi":"10.1109\/TDC.2006.1668506"},{"isbn":"0-7803-9208-6","py":"2005","spage":"2013","abstract":"The storage system in this paper is made of supercapacitors.

But for highly complex product families like a vehicle manufacturer's product range comprising well-above a thousand technical features - they become very large, and thus cumbersome and inflexible, especially when managing changes to the tree's structure over a long time. Furthermore, a conflict of aims arises when using feature trees in large organizations: while a single global feature tree for the entire company is desirable, local amendments for individual units or projects are indispensable in practice. In this paper, we present a detailed description of this problem and show its great relevance to the automotive domain. We then provide a detailed definition of multi-level feature trees as a possible solution to the above problem.

As many types of these resources generate electrical energy in the form of DC voltage source, they need a DC\/AC converter for energy transfer to the grid. Static converters are usually connected to the utility grid through a simple L filter to reduce the injected current harmonics. However, LCL filters can provide better harmonic attenuation and reduce the filter size at the same time. This paper is concerned with the subject of grid connected converters using LCL filter topology. Basic expressions related to LCL filters are derived and compared to that of L filter. Design criteria with respect to filter size, ripple current and resonance frequency are addressed.

With the increasing reliance of the distribution system on DGs and knowing that DGs can provide many favorable aspects, other than providing active power, new interface controls have been proposed recently. Most of the current proposed DG interface controls are designed to supply both active and reactive power to provide voltage support and power factor improvement and this in turn could have an impact on islanding detection. Islanding detection methods are designed for DGs operating at unity power factor.

The proposed mixing device is power-free in the sense that the surface tension is the only force that transports, merges, mixes, and stops the liquid. It is cost-effective that the channel has no sidewalls with the liquid being confined to flow between a bottom hydrophilic stripe and a top-covered hydrophobic substrate. Moreover, asymmetric staggered cavities (Stroock et al., Science, 2002, 295, 647) are optimally arranged on the bottom substrate of the channel to help mixing two different liquid species. It is most crucial to this power-free mixing device that two liquid species must be well mixed before the liquids are transported to exit the channel by the surface tension.

When a PFC capacitor is installed with a certain load in a microgrid, it may be in parallel with the filter capacitor of the inverter interfacing the utility grid and the local DG and thus change the effective filter capacitance. Another complication is the possibility of occurrence of resonance in the microgrid. This paper conducts an in-depth investigation of the effective shunt filter capacitance variation and resonance phenomena in a microgrid due to connection of a PFC capacitor. To compensate the capacitance parameter variation, an H&infin; controller is designed for the VSI voltage control. By properly choosing the weighting functions the synthesized H&infin; controller would exhibit high gains at the vicinity of the line frequency, similar to traditional high performance P+resonant controller, and thus would possess nearly zero steady state error. However with the robust H&infin; controller, it will be possible to explicitly specify the degree of robustness in face of parameter variations. Furthermore, a thorough investigation is carried out to study the performance of inner current loop feedback variables under resonance conditions. It reveals that filter inductor current feedback is more effective in damping the resonance. This resonance can be further attenuated by employing the dual-inverter microgrid conditioner and controlling the series inverter as a virtual resistor affecting only harmonic components without affecting the fundamental power flow.","arnumber":"1518803","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Robust control scheme for a microgrid with PFC capacitor connected]]>","partnum":"1518803","pubtitle":"Industry Applications Conference, 2005.

These wind turbine concept models can be used and even extended for the study of different aspects, e.g. the assessment of power quality, control strategies, connection of the wind turbine at different types of grid and storage systems","arnumber":"4078625","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Output Power Maximization of a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator Based Stand-alone Wind Turbine]]>","partnum":"4078625","pubtitle":"Industrial Electronics, 2006 IEEE International Symposium on","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4078625","epage":"2416","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4078625&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"1111","punumber":"4035454","publicationid":"4078625","doi":"10.1109\/ISIE.2006.295950"},{"isbn":"0-7803-8879-8","py":"2005","spage":"576","abstract":"Ionic polymer metal composites (IPMCs) are emerging materials used to realize motion sensors and actuators.

This paper details our study to produce a micro patterned embossing roll with a 3D X-ray lithography process. More specifically, the outer surface of a cylindrical steel roll (12 mm in diameter) was coated with photo resist, and 3D X-ray lithography with synchrotron radiation was employed to fabricate a hole-shaped pattern (approx. 10 mum in diameter) on the outer surface. The outer surface of the roll was then plated with copper to fabricate copper dots (each approx. 10 mum in diameter), which were used as etching masks to perform wet etching on the roll. Consequently, we were able to fabricate a structure whose outer surface is dotted with numerous microstructures. However, edge of the pattern part that was masked by copper was underetched, and the expected shape was not able to obtain. Then, we examined the possibility of the processing by the verification of the problem of a wet etching, and the dry etching","arnumber":"4110398","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Development of Roll Metal Mold by Synchrotron Radiation]]>","partnum":"4110398","pubtitle":"Micro-NanoMechatronics and Human Science, 2006 International Symposium on","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4110398","epage":"6","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4110398&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"1113","punumber":"4110307","publicationid":"4110398","doi":"10.1109\/MHS.2006.320295"},{"isbn":"0-7803-9033-4","py":"2005","spage":"2501","abstract":"The need for interconnecting distributed generators or DG's with electric power systems has raised a number of technical issues that has resulted in the development of new interconnection standards.

The main purposes of hierarchical islanding are to achieve stable islanding and utilize the DG contribution to system availability under conditions of major system disturbance. Substation Islanding is the first choice. When the inter-ties faults occur, the Substation Island is split from the grid and achieves stable islanding.

As a result, the power quality i.e. the reliability of the energy supply and the quality of the voltage waveform, may be severely degraded. Especially in the case of resonances, severe voltage distortion can be the result. Both harmonic voltage and current distortion may cause many unfavourable effects on both the power system and the connected loads. Although complete compensation is only possible using true active filters, resistive shunt harmonic impedances (SHI) have been shown to provide a considerable reduction of the harmonic distortion. These impedances can be implemented using active power electronic devices which are controlled to synthesize a resistive load. Benefits are: no need to measure the polluting current of non-linear loads, effective for all harmonics and different resonance conditions, simple control strategy, and possible implementation as a secondary control function of active power supplies and distributed power inverters. In this paper, a practical implementation of a resistive SHI is proposed. A new control strategy for a full-bridge ac-dc converter has been implemented in order to achieve a programmable resistive input impedance for harmonics, independent of the input impedance for the fundamental component.

It provides structural and environmental protection for MEMS devices to enhance their reliability. Major problems with the packaging process include degraded reliability caused by the excess stress due thermal mismatch in the die attach, wire bonding, flip chip, and lid sealing phases of the process, and altered performance of the MEMS device after packaging caused by thermal exposure. As a consequence, local heating and rapid heating approaches, such as resistive micro-heaters, rapid thermal processing (RTP), and laser bonding, have been developed for MEMS packaging. This paper investigates the localized laser bonding technique for ceramic MEMS packaging. A continuous wave CO<sub>2<\/sub> laser (wave length = 10.6 mum) is applied as a heat source to locally heat ceramic (Al<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>3<\/sub>) MEMS packages for lid to substrate bonding. To determine the laser power density and scanning speed, a FEA (finite element analysis) thermal model is constructed to simulate the localized laser bonding process. The modeling results provide a guideline for selection of the laser bonding parameters and assist optimization of the packaging process. Further, the effect of external pressure at sealing ring on the forming of bond is studied. To evaluate the laser bonded packages, pull tests are conducted. It is found that the scanning speed and external pressure have significant influence on the pull strength at the bonding interface. The packages are then cross-sectioned and polished, and the bonding interface is inspected under a microscope and scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive spectrometer. Experimental results show that packages bonded with relatively low scanning speed and external pressure conditions have higher bonding quality.

These objectives usually contradict each other and cannot be handled by conventional single optimization techniques, while multi-objective (MO) methods fit naturally. This is the case of the placement of a large amount of distributed generation (DG) into an existing distribution network, that has simultaneously the potentiality of achieving great savings (e.g. deferment of investments and reduction of power losses) or causing technical problems (e.g. overvoltages and\/or overloads), depending on the DG size and location. In this paper, an evolutionary MO procedure for the optimal DG siting and sizing is proposed. The goal of this methodology is to establish the best penetration level of DG, which maximizes the benefits of the presence of generators in a distribution network, as well to limit the network performance deterioration due to DG not connected in optimal locations.

In a distributed power system, islanding may occur at different possible zones consisting of distribution feeders, substations and voltage levels as long as the isolated zone is found to operate independently of the main grid but remained energized by the distributed generation unit. To ensure safety and reliability, it is necessary to detect islanding condition as quickly as possible by using anti-islanding algorithms. Among the available islanding prevention methods, slip mode frequency shift (SMS) and phase jump detection (PJD) schemes are very common and have numerous advantages over others. This paper presents detailed discussion and comparison of the characteristics of the various anti-islanding schemes. Both SMS and PJD techniques are examined in detail through design and simulation. In the islanding situation with quality factor range (0.1les Q<sub>f<\/sub> les10), load voltage waveforms are analyzed and plotted. Both the methods are assessed in terms of detection times with different Q<sub>f<\/sub>'s.

Over the last years, LTCC materials and production processes have been further developed to meet the needs of these applications. As a result, the layouts of LTCC-modules are characterized by increasing circuit complexity and packaging density. Accordingly, the numbers of layers and vias are increasing, while the dimensions of the circuitry (lines and spaces) are decreasing. On the other side, conventional screen printing is limited to approximately 100 mum of line width (in volume production). This is why photoimageable thick film technology is used in applications requiring high packaging density. Another consequence of shrinking circuit dimensions is the need to reduce the size of via holes, which are usually fabricated by punching or laser drilling. This paper reports results regarding the formation of vias in LTCC tapes.

To realize large Schottky barrier heights (SBHs), Pt films were deposited by a pulsed in-situ electrochemical process. Upon exposure to hydrogen in air, the Pt\/InP Schottky diode exhibited remarkably large increase of forward and reverse currents. The sensing mechanism is explained in terms of SBH changes caused by interface dipole formed at Pt\/InP interface due to the adsorbed atomic hydrogen.

We propose a protocol, geographic energy-aware blacklisting routing with energy supply (GEBRES), which makes routing decision locally by jointly taking into account multiple factors-the realistic wireless channel condition, packets advancement to the destination, the energy availability on the node with environmental energy supply. Simulation results show that GEBRES is more energy efficient than the corresponding residual energy based protocols without considering the property of the energy changing (including recharging and consuming) rate. In particular, given the same energy and traffic models, GEBRES maintains higher minimum residual energy on nodes and achieves better load balancing in terms of having a smaller standard deviation of residual energy among nodes. GEBRES exhibits a little degradation on end-to-end delay, but does not compromise the end-to-end throughput performance","arnumber":"4086875","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Energy-Efficient Geographic Routing in Environmentally Powered Wireless Sensor Networks]]>","partnum":"4086875","pubtitle":"Military Communications Conference, 2006.

In this contribution several options for voltage control in distribution networks are analyzed and related to important grid parameters such as the short-circuit ratio and the X\/R ratio of the grid. For networks with a high X\/R ratio reactive power can be used for voltage control. For networks with a low X\/R ratio several new voltage control techniques are proposed.

In this paper, we propose Tunable Security Model (TSM) to minimize energy consumption while providing security services such that the user's security level requirement is satisfied.

Under heavy load, the power system can become unstable exhibiting voltage drops that may lead to a voltage collapse. This paper addresses the load sharing control associated with the parallel operation of DG's in order to maintain voltage stability. A general control strategy, involving modeling and control of parallel operating DG's having non-linear dynamics, varying with load is developed. This control action regulates the voltage under imbalance condition of loads. Simulation results show that the proposed method is effective in displaying a reliable and robust control performance. Simulations are performed with a model composed of two DG's units, two loads and wire impedances. Different cases like, power ratings and loads on both the units being equal, power rating and loads on both the units being unequal, and suddenly varying load conditions are taken up for analysis and simulation.","arnumber":"1460950","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Load sharing control in distributed generation system]]>","partnum":"1460950","pubtitle":"System Theory, 2005.

To achieve maximum voltage support from DG utilisation, methodologies related to DG placement and DG operation are developed in this paper. Technique to optimise voltage improvement by effectively injecting active and reactive power of DG is developed based on voltage sensitivity of lines. An index has been developed to obtain optimal or near optimal placement of DG for maximum voltage improvement in a distribution feeder.

DG is utilized to help to regulate the system voltage profile to lie close to the desired value, i.e. to reduce the voltage variation. With the varieties of dispersed locations, operating modes, and allowable sizes, DG can be properly designed and controlled to be a powerful means of voltage regulation, and work parallel with the existing voltage regulation. However, it is known that DG may cause the voltage fluctuation to the system due to the counter flow and reactive power change. According to the conflict features of DG over system voltages, the contribution of DG to the voltage regulation is obtained by the optimization process. This is carried out simultaneously with the adjustment of voltage regulator setting. Besides, the issue of stochastic attribute of DG is taken into account. Probabilistic load flow (PLF) is employed to cope with this concern. The proposed method has been applied to the IEEE 34-Bus distribution test system. The results show that the proposed method yields a satisfactory voltage regulation while the uncertainty from renewable energy resource is considered.","arnumber":"4115925","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Contribution of Distributed Generation to Voltage Regulation under Stochastic Attribute of Renewable Energy Resources]]>","partnum":"4115925","pubtitle":"Power System Technology, 2006.

IVHM is the process of assessing, preserving, and restoring system functionality across flight and ground systems. The framework presented in this paper integrates advanced computational techniques with sensor and communication technologies for spacecraft that can generate responses through detection, diagnosis, reasoning, and adapt to system faults in support of IIVM. These real-time responses allow the IIVM to modify the affected vehicle subsystem(s) prior to a catastrophic event. Furthermore, the objective of this pilot program is to develop and integrate technologies which can provide a continuous, intelligent, and adaptive health state of a vehicle and use this information to improve safety and reduce costs of operations. Recent investments in avionics, health management, and controls have been directed towards IIVM. As this concept has matured, it has become clear that IIVM requires the same sensors and processing capabilities as the real-time avionics functions to support diagnosis of subsystem problems. New sensors have been proposed, in addition to augment the avionics sensors to support better system monitoring and diagnostics. As the designs have been considered, a synergy has been realized where the real-time avionics can utilize sensors proposed for diagnostics and prognostics to make better real-time decisions in response to detected failures. IIVM provides for a single system allowing modularity of functions and hardware across the vehicle. The framework that supports IIVM consists of 11 major on-board functions necessary to fully manage a space vehicle maintaining crew safety and mission objectives. These- - systems include the following: guidance and navigation; communications and tracking; vehicle monitoring; information transport and integration; vehicle diagnostics; vehicle prognostics; vehicle mission planning; automated repair and replacement; vehicle control; human computer interface; and onboard verification and validation. Furthermore, the presented framework provides complete vehicle management which not only allows for increased crew safety and mission success through new intelligence capabilities, but also yields a mechanism for more efficient vehicle operations. The representative IVHM technologies for IIVM includes: 1) enhanced communications and telemetry, 2) sensors for radiation materials, 3) vehicle controls and dynamics, 4) flight mechanics and control, 4) embedded sensors for structural integrity of tanking systems, 5) evolutionary concepts for embedded sensor placement in tank systems, 6) real time operating systems, and 7) computer architectures for distributed processing for IVHM.

For reliable input to a grid the inverter needs a stiff input Dc voltage. To minimize switching loss and avoid switching over voltages a resonant converter is used. This also has the advantage of minimizing EMC. To gain the necessary DC voltage at the inverter input, it is necessary to use a DC\/DC step-up converter. The necessary requirements are met with an H-bridge converter. Connected to the output of the converter is a series combination of the transformer primary and a capacitor such that the capacitor resonates with the transformer's leakage inductance at the switching frequency. The transformer's output is rectified and filtered for input to the inverter. Results from simulation tests confirm the current's resonant pattern. Yet further results are shown of the converter's performance at different loadings to confirm the zero-current switching effects.

Therefore, a neural network classification is applied to the fault diagnosis of a MLID system. Five multilayer perceptron (MLP) networks are used to identify the type and location of occurring faults. The neural network design process is clearly described. The classification performance of the proposed network between normal and abnormal condition is about 90 %, and the classification performance among fault features is about 85 %. Thus, by utilizing the proposed neural network fault diagnosis system, a better understanding about fault behaviors, diagnostics, and detections of a multilevel inverter drive system can be accomplished.

The voltage regulation procedure follows iteratively two steps combining a genetic algorithm with a linearly constrained optimization method. Firstly, the genetic algorithm set the most promising distributed generation siting and sizing configurations and, secondly, for each configuration, the constrained optimization method is applied in order to find the operating point for all distributed generators that optimizes the voltage profile.

In many scientific data analysis applications, \"interesting\" data can be defined by compound Boolean range queries of the form (temperature>1000) AND (70<pressure<90). As data sizes grow larger, a central challenge is to answer such queries as efficiently as possible. Prior work in the visualization community has focused on answering range queries for scalar fields within the context of accelerating the search phase of isosurface algorithms. In contrast, our work describes an approach that leverages state-of-the-art indexing technology from the scientific data management community called \"bitmap indexing\". Our implementation, which we call \"DEX\" (short for dextrous data explorer), uses bitmap indexing to efficiently answer multivariate, multidimensional data queries to provide input to a visualization pipeline. We present an analysis overview and benchmark results that show bitmap indexing offers significant storage and performance improvements when compared to previous approaches for accelerating the search phase of isosurface algorithms. More importantly, since bitmap indexing supports complex multidimensional, multivariate range queries, it is more generally applicable to scientific data visualization and analysis problems. In addition to benchmark performance and analysis, we apply DEX to a typical scientific visualization problem encountered in combustion simulation data analysis.","arnumber":"1532792","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Query-driven visualization of large data sets]]>","partnum":"1532792","pubtitle":"Visualization, 2005.

In this approach, fully distributed data aggregation and integration can be performed in a scalable fashion where individual motes operate based on local information, making local decisions that achieve globally-meaningful effects.

Effective conversion of these microorganisms or \"waste activated sludge\" (WAS) to biogas in an anaerobic digester and converting this biogas to energy are the two most important steps that a WWTP can take to minimize its direct and indirect generation of GHGs. Maximizing biogas production can decrease a WWTP's reliance on non-renewable energy sources that generate GHGs as well as decrease the costs of purchased energy. Sludge that is not converted to biogas will lead to GHG emissions to the atmosphere. Therefore, minimizing the amount of residual sludge that must be hauled off site to be either landfilled, applied to agricultural land, or incinerated also minimizes GHG emissions. Conventional mesophilic (37degC) anaerobic digesters (CMADs) at municipal WWTPs are not efficient at converting WAS to biogas, achieving 15 to 30% volatile solids reduction of WAS in typical 15 day treatment times. They capture only a small fraction (15 to 30%) of their biogas potential, resulting in a large portion (70 to 85%) of biosolids that still require disposal. Pre-treatment of WAS is needed to improve the performance of anaerobic digestion. MicroSludge is a sludge pre-treatment technology that greatly improves the efficiency of anaerobic digestion of WAS. MicroSludge results in: (1) more recoverable energy from biogas being available and therefore less non-renewable energy required to operate a WWTP; (2) less residual solids requiring transport either to a landfill, land application site, or incinerator; and (3) fewer GHGs being generated from the fugitive emissions of less residuals.","arnumber":"4057340","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[How Microsludge Can Lower Greenhouse Gases at Wastewater Treatment Plants]]>","partnum":"4057340","pubtitle":"EIC Climate Change Technology, 2006 IEEE","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4057340","epage":"14","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4057340&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"1256","punumber":"4057290","publicationid":"4057340","doi":"10.1109\/EICCCC.2006.277210"},{"isbn":"978-186135-342-9","py":"2006","spage":"472","abstract":"Because of the certain stochastic nature of renewable generation, large-scale distributed generation systems can impose unpredictable impact on the stability of their integrated transmission systems. This paper demonstrates that power system oscillations can be caused by unpredictable changes of operating conditions of integrated distributed generation systems and hence presents a novel method of power system damping control by applying the operational principle of immune system. The proposed immune damping control is to mimic the immune response, to identify and respond to disturbance, and keep a healthy level of power system oscillation damping. The proposed artificial immune control acts by monitoring the health index in real time and performing immune feedback to maintain required healthy level of power system damping such that oscillations are suppressed effectively. It does not need to establish detailed parametric model of studied power system, neither its operating conditions, for the design of the damping controller. Hence it is a robust and modeling-free scheme of power system damping control. In the paper an example power system integrated with large-scale distributed generation systems is presented. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the artificial immune control method in variable circumstances of power system operation.","arnumber":"4218729","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[On-Line Stability Control of Power Systems Integrated with Distributed Generation Systems]]>","partnum":"4218729","pubtitle":"Universities Power Engineering Conference, 2006.

An inflow scenario tree must be correctly dimensioned so as to provide a parsimonious - but still representative - sample of the multivariate process underlying possible future inflows. In this article we propose a methodology to generate such a tree. The idea is to use principal component analysis to reduce the effective dimensionality of the scenario specification problem so that a discretization technique can be used in a smaller dimensional space.

Here is a methodology that illustrates the use of a testability analysis tool to aid in the design and development of a health management system. Included is a brief discussion of how the model's testability output metrics can be used in conjunction with other types of model outputs for optimization purposes. Some top-level figures of merit are targeted here to verify that the testability analysis data is adequate and valid. It is shown here that this technology can improve maintenance efficiency, and aid in automating an integrated vehicle health management (IVHM) system, while reducing the need for human interaction for decision making, data acquisition and testing. The technology identifies critical components in the system, and prescribes a fast and accurate failure detection and isolation method that diagnoses faults to the lowest level of ambiguity. The safety, reliability and testability metrics identified here are used to reduce the test stand operator's stress levels by increasing the confidence in the operational state of the system, especially those related to critical components, before and during tests. Consequently, confidence in the test stand output data from the test article is realized. It is proven here that this technology also adds confidence in sustainability improvement of the test stand, which is above and beyond meeting just performance specifications. False alarms and false replacement concerns are also addressed here. The importance of using today's testability analysis tools for assessing and optimizing integrated vehicle health management systems is emphasized in this paper.

A muG is an association of a low voltage distribution network, small modular generation systems (micro-generators), loads and storage devices having some local coordinated functions. This entity can operate in two different modes: interconnected or emergency. In the first mode, the microgrid is connected with the distribution network, importing or exporting electricity and\/or ancillary services. When in emergency mode, the microgrid operates isolated from the distribution network and uses local resources, changing from power control to frequency control and, if necessary, shedding load. A micro grid will only be established if its promoters achieve sufficient advantages that justify the incurred costs, namely the investment, operation and maintenance costs. The main purpose of this paper is to identify all the relevant costs and benefits and build a decision model for the situation, taking into account the regulatory framework, which is essential for the definition of some of the benefits. The paper also shows how to include in the evaluation the risk associated to the uncertainties in data and parameters.

The primary specification for this hybrid hydraulic-electric power unit (HEPU) is that it must output constant pressure hydraulic power and constant voltage electric power. An on-board computer uses a pressure sensor and a speed sensor to regulate the pressure and voltage by modulating a hydraulic solenoid valve and an engine throttle. The speed regulation also results in a system noise with predictable frequency band which allows for optimal muffler design. A novel characteristic of this power source is its cooling system in which hydraulic fluid is used to cool the engine cylinders.

PET scans were carried on, with a continuous infusion of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), during 2 hours including the 30 min duration of the illumination. The usual FDG kinetic model was modified to include the effects of the treatment. Since the blood supply to the tumors was affected by the illumination during the PET scans, the input curve was derived from factor analysis.

Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles share many component and powertrain architecture commonalities with power assist hybrid electric vehicles-but with the ability to recharge a larger energy storage system from off-board electrical power. The PHEV has unique battery requirements that often require a compromise between the high energy battery systems required by battery electric vehicles (BEV) and the high power energy storage systems used in power assist hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). The duty cycle is generally a combination of deep and shallow discharge behavior found respectively in BEVs and HEVs and is dependent on both vehicle requirements and the energy management strategy of the hybrid powertrain.","arnumber":"1554580","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Battery evaluation for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles]]>","partnum":"1554580","pubtitle":"Vehicle Power and Propulsion, 2005 IEEE Conference","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1554580","epage":"","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1554580&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"1295","punumber":"10416","publicationid":"1554580","doi":"10.1109\/VPPC.2005.1554580"},{"isbn":"0-7803-9510-7","py":"2006","spage":"2000","abstract":"Land ecosystems, in particular forest ecosystems, are under increasing pressure from environmental changes such as population growth, global warming, wildfires, forest insects, and diseases.

AFSEO performs test and evaluation for aircraft\/store compatibility certification and uses Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to support this process. Determining the flow about an aircraft\/store combination can be extremely difficult. Complicated geometry such as pylons, launchers, grid fins, and internal weapons bays create severe acoustic and aerothermodynamic environments, which are challenging to numerically simulate. The additional challenge of rapidly and accurately modeling and simulating the trajectory of a store separation in a high-volume simulation environment is beyond the capabilities of most CFD programs. The USAF requirement for numerous, simultaneous and quick-reaction solutions for a wide variety of stores and aircraft can only be accomplished through application of parallel high-performance computing resources that meet the significant computational and memory demands. This project increases combat capability for the current USAF fleet of tactical and strategic aircraft with associated weapon systems. Before operational use, all aircraft\/ store configurations must be certified for safe loading, carriage and jettison\/release. AFSEO provides flight certification recommendations, based on combinations of engineering analysis, ground and flight testing. Engineering analyses come from disciplines in carriage loads, store separations, flutter, ballistics, stability and control, and electromagnetic compatibility and interference. The AFSEO CFD team provides timecritical support for engineering design and analysis in the form of computed aircraft\/store carriage aerodynamic loads, predicted store separation characteristics, changes in aerodynamic properties and performance due to design modifications, and visualized flow field physics used to optimize the application of ground and flight testing, reducing risk and lowering cost of fielding new weapons.

Their estimated impact on emissions is of the order of 50 Mt\/y CO<sub>2e<\/sub>, at an environmental cost ranging from negative, for many bioenergy projects, to $10-15\/t of CO<sub>2e<\/sub> for Small Hydro and other projects. The fastest growing renewable energy options for electricity supplies in Canada are currently Wind and Small Hydro. It is estimated that the wind energy installed capacity will be between 7,000 and 8,000 MW by 2012 and 20,000 MW by 2025. Currently, the installed capacity is about 680 MW and growing rapidly. Small Hydro projects account for about 2,500 MW and are also growing rapidly. The resource potential for doubling the current contribution of Small Hydro is well known and there is growing public interest to access it.","arnumber":"4057322","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Potential for Electricity Generation from Emerging Renewable Sources in Canada]]>","partnum":"4057322","pubtitle":"EIC Climate Change Technology, 2006 IEEE","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4057322","epage":"10","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4057322&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"1310","punumber":"4057290","publicationid":"4057322","doi":"10.1109\/EICCCC.2006.277192"},{"isbn":"1-4244-0227-1","py":"2006","spage":"79","abstract":"The demand of electricity is increasing day by day.

However, as the loads and system topology in a power system vary time to time, these static-oriented methods are of limited use for this issue. More recently, as the emergence of another member of the EA family-bacterial foraging algorithm (BFA), the self- adaptability of individuals in the group searching activities has attracted a great deal of interests. Inspired from this algorithm, this paper presents a novel way to tackle the OPF problem from a non-static point of view. Based on the original BFA, an approach called dynamic bacterial foraging algorithm (DBFA) is proposed for the problem of OPF with dynamic loads. This approach has been examined and evaluated on the standard IEEE 30-bus test system. The simulation studies offer a range of changes in a dynamic environment. The simulation results show that DBFA can adapt to various environmental changes which occur in different probabilities, in comparison with a recent work on bacterial foraging [3] and particle swarm optimizer (PSO).","arnumber":"4116342","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Optimal Power Flow With Dynamic Loads Using Bacterial Foraging Algorithm]]>","partnum":"4116342","pubtitle":"Power System Technology, 2006.

Moreover, the submerged Krakens travel at a depth of 100 meters or more, where there is no wave or storm action. As a result, the probability of damaging or losing Krakens due to storms or collisions is virtually zero. Conventional surface ships and submersibles are based on rigid assemblies of steel plates and beams that must operate in severe storms and high wave conditions. They are expensive to build and have to operate at relatively high speeds to return their investment. As a result, propulsion power and energy requirements per unit amount of cargo are high. Typically, the overall cost of transport, amortized capital plus energy, is about 1 cent per ton mile. Not only does this substantially increase the cost of commodities like oil, coal, etc. that are transported over long distances, but it also rules out transporting cargoes such as fresh water, because the cost is too great.

High spectral resolution is usually needed to gain a certain accuracy in the retrieval process. However, this great amount of information makes mandatory a reduction of the dimensionality of the problem. In this sense a careful selection of wavelengths in the spectrum must be performed. With this purpose principal component analysis technique is used to automatically determine those wavelengths in the spectrum that carry relevant information on temperature distribution.

The proposed MAS-IIS is one of the functions in multi-agent system based intelligent control systems (MAS-ICSs) which has several functions that provide efficient ways to control locally and globally, and to accommodate and overcome the complexity of large-scale distributed systems","arnumber":"1709612","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[A multi-agent system-based intelligent identification system for power plant control and fault-diagnosis]]>","partnum":"1709612","pubtitle":"Power Engineering Society General Meeting, 2006.

Performance places increased demands on the vehicle energy storage system (ESS) in the form of higher power cycling and thermal dissipation. Energy management strategies (EMS) have become very prominent in the need to manage the multiple power sources via efficiency optimizing control of engine output, floating bus voltage level on the generator and motor, electronically controlled brakes, and converter buffering of the traction battery.

Buoys which drift off-location can pose hazards to mariners, and in coastal waters may cause environmental damage. Moreover, retrieval, repair and replacement of drifting buoys may be delayed when data would be most useful. Such gaps in coastal buoy data can pose a threat to national security by reducing maritime domain awareness. The concept of self-positioning buoys has been advanced to reduce installation cost by eliminating mooring hardware. We here describe technology for operation of reduced cost self-positioning buoys which can be used in coastal or oceanic waters. The ASC SCOUT model is based on a self-propelled, GPS-positioned, autonomous surface craft that can be pre-programmed, autonomous, or directed in real time. Each vessel can communicate wirelessly with deployment vessels and other similar buoys directly or via satellite. Engineering options for short or longer term power requirements are considered, in addition to future options for improved energy delivery systems. Methods of reducing buoy drift and position-maintaining energy requirements for self-locating buoys are also discussed, based on the potential of incorporating traditional maritime solutions to these problems. We here include discussion of the advanced Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) communications draft protocol which offers improved wireless communication capabilities underwater, to adjacent vessels, and to satellites. DTN is particularly adapted for noisy or loss-prone environments, thus it improves reliability. In addition to existing buoy communication via commercial satellites, a growing network of small satellites known as PICOSATs can be readily adapted to provide low-cost communications nodes for buoys.

This concept implies a consumer-oriented industry driven by software from the top, and enabled (and constrained) by nano-scale physics at the atomic level. \"More-Moore\" will be needed to deliver the giga-ops computation and GHz communication capabilities required for stationary and wearable devices. But AmI also creates new challenges at the architectural and physical levels. To make AmI possible, AmI devices need two-orders-of-magnitude-lower power dissipation than today's microprocessors, at one-twentieth of the cost. These requirements conflict with the embedded programmability needed for personalization and adaptation to new services. We focus on emerging techniques for bridging this gap between software-centric systems and power-efficient platform architectures for AmI devices. A second challenge is to cope with the fact that nano-scale physical phenomena are in conflict with the traditional \"nice and predictable\" digital abstractions now used for complexity management. Techniques for coping with uncertainty and signal degradation, while achieving better-than-worst-case design, are discussed. Finally, one must realize that, to facilitate AmI, \"more-than-Moore\" technology is required, for example, for the design of autonomous wireless sensor networks. Correspondingly, attention is paid to novel combinations of technologies above and around CMOS, for the design of ultra-low-power, ultra-simple sensor motes for AmI.","arnumber":"1493857","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Ambient intelligence: gigascale dreams and nanoscale realities]]>","partnum":"1493857","pubtitle":"Solid-State Circuits Conference, 2005.

The useable energy density of commercially available carbon\/carbon devices is between 3.5 and 4.5 Wh\/kg.

The pseudo-capacitive devices have higher energy densities in the range of 10-13 Wh\/kg for constant power discharges less than 500 W\/kg, but the energy density decreases significantly at higher power densities. Projections of future development indicate that the energy density of the carbon\/carbon devices will increase to 5-6 Wh\/kg in the relatively near future along with higher power densities of 1500-3000 W\/kg. In the case of the pseudo-capacitive approaches, the carbon\/PbO<sub>2<\/sub> device looks particularly promising from both the performance and cost points-of-view primarily because of its relationship to the low cost lead-acid battery. Costs of the carbon\/carbon ultracapacitors are expected to continue to decrease from the present costs of 2-3 cents\/Farad to about 0.5 cents\/Farad. Further reductions in cost require a low cost carbon of $5-$10\/kg. Comparisons of the costs of ultracapacitor and battery energy storage units for mild hybrid vehicles depend critically on the energy storage requirement (Wh) assumed for the ultracapacitor unit. If the storage requirement is less than 100 Wh, there is a strong possibility that ultracapacitors can compete with nickel metal hydride and lithium-ion batteries in the future hybrid vehicles.","arnumber":"1554583","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[The present and projected performance and cost of double-layer pseudo-capacitive ultracapacitors for hybrid vehicle applications]]>","partnum":"1554583","pubtitle":"Vehicle Power and Propulsion, 2005 IEEE Conference","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1554583","epage":"","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1554583&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"1346","punumber":"10416","publicationid":"1554583","doi":"10.1109\/VPPC.2005.1554583"},{"isbn":"0-7695-2589-X","py":"2006","spage":"189","abstract":"Today there is a proliferation of research into systems based on the autonomous agent, multi-agent and holonic paradigms.

Recent trends towards environmentally conscious design and construction have resulted in a focus on the environmental impacts of material selection, with emphasis on a life cycle approach. This paper will demonstrate how one might use a life cycle analysis approach to determine optimal insulation levels with a sole focus on environmental impact. The demonstration will include an analysis of commercial roof insulation and residential attic insulation taking into consideration their respective environmental life cycle burdens and operating energy environmental impacts. Embodied environmental material impacts will be estimated using ATHENA's Environmental Impact Estimator software. The ATHENA software is a Canadian developed and internationally recognized means of obtaining comprehensive and reliable environmental life cycle burdens of building assemblies. It covers building material and system life cycle stages from the \"cradle\" (natural resource extraction or recycling facility) through to its \"end-of-life\" (grave). For this paper, results reporting of material effects will include embodied energy and global warming potential as indicators of environmental burden. For this paper, two Ottawa buildings will be simulated several times. Each of the simulations will have identical building properties, with the exception of roof or attic insulation, which will vary by amount for each simulation. The analysis will focus on the operational differences between the various roof insulation options, and the development of the operational environmental effects of these different options. For the commercial building, operational energy will be estimated using a DOE 2.2 based whole building operating energy simulator such as EQUEST or EE-4. The building used for the modeling will be an existing two-storey commercial office building. The residential building will be- - simulated using HOT 2000 software from NRCan. These simulation software systems will allow detailed analysis of building materials and systems including the effects of HVAC systems, envelope systems, geometry, size and location. The paper will present \"payback periods\" based not on cost, but on environmental effects, for different amounts of insulation. We will demonstrate a method to determine the level of insulation at which the material environmental burden of the insulation exceeds the operational benefits of the insulation. The process used will demonstrate a method to allow building designers the opportunity to base their decision making with respect to roof or attic insulation on environmental effects rather than cost.","arnumber":"4057336","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Material and Operational Environmental Impacts of Building Insulation: How Much is Enough?]]>","partnum":"4057336","pubtitle":"EIC Climate Change Technology, 2006 IEEE","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4057336","epage":"13","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4057336&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"1353","punumber":"4057290","publicationid":"4057336","doi":"10.1109\/EICCCC.2006.277206"},{"isbn":"0-7695-2797-3","py":"2006","spage":"45","abstract":"The Air Force SEEK EAGLE Office (AFSEO), Eglin Air Force Base (AFB), FL, is the United States Air Force (USAF) authority for weapons certification efforts. AFSEO performs test and evaluation for aircraft\/store compatibility certification. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is employed to support this process. Determining the flow about an aircraft\/store combination may be extremely difficult. Complicated geometry features such as pylons, launchers, grid fins, and internal weapons bays create severe aerothermodynamic and acoustic environments which are challenging to simulate numerically. Rapidly and accurately modeling the trajectory of store separation in a high-volume simulation environment presents an additional challenge. The USAF requirement for numerous, simultaneous and quick-reaction solutions for a wide variety of stores and aircraft can only be accomplished through application of parallel high-performance computing resources that meet the significant computational and memory demands associated with the certification computational environment. Before operational use, all aircraft\/store configurations must be certified for safe loading, carriage, and jettison\/release. AFSEO provides flight certification recommendations which are based on combinations of engineering analysis, ground, and flight testing.

This program is under contract with NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). The Glory satellite bus was previously used for the vegetation canopy LIDAR (VCL) program, a mission designed to measure the Earth's vegetation coverage, depth, and topography by using short laser pulses from a LIDAR (light detection and ranging) system. The Glory program is refurbishing the VCL bus that was in the middle of integration and test when the VCL program was shut down. Many changes are being made to the VCL bus to configure it to serve the Glory science mission objectives. The Glory science mission includes polar atmospheric aerosol measurements with cloud observation and total solar irradiance monitoring. The low Earth orbit satellite (LEO) is scheduled for launch in late 2007 with the intention of broadening the search for the causes of global warming. The mission is intended to measure the composition of greenhouse gases, which little is known about currently, as well as solar effects on the environment using the following instruments: an aerosol polarimetry sensor (APS), cloud cameras and a total irradiance monitor (TIM). The APS instrument is a multispectral polarimetric sensor designed for collection of visible, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared polarized radiometric data scattered from aerosols and clouds. The APS is a continuous scanning, nadir-viewing sensor that makes along-track, multiangle observations of Earth and atmospheric spectral radiance. The cloud cameras are dual-band, imagers that employ a nonscanning, staring detector array that is akin to a star tracker, but Earth-viewing. The cloud cameras provide continuous cross-track coverage over a narrow swath centered on the APS along-track footprint using an optical imaging system. The TIM is an active cavity solar irradiance radiometer that consists of four identical radiometer cavities to provide redundancy and help- detect changes in instrument response caused by exposure to solar radiation and other orbital effects. It takes data continuously throughout the orbit and does periodic calibrations on the disc of the sun and of the redundant cavities to monitor the effects of aging. Using a combination of heritage data and knowledge from the Orb View 3 and 4 programs as well as VCL, the Glory program is dedicated to a successful mission. This paper describes the design differences at system and subsystem levels between VCL and Glory focusing on the science missions, as well as the heritage program influences that are employed.","arnumber":"1559334","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[The story of Glory: Earth and solar science on one unique satellite]]>","partnum":"1559334","pubtitle":"Aerospace Conference, 2005 IEEE","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1559334","epage":"431","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1559334&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"1362","punumber":"10432","publicationid":"1559334","doi":"10.1109\/AERO.2005.1559334"},{"isbn":"1-4244-0474-6","py":"2006","spage":"202","abstract":"Five University of Virginia Systems Engineering students worked in partnership with Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to develop a handbook detailing agency benefits from regional transportation collaboration.

In order to provide meaningful visualizations and to extract useful knowledge from document collections, user needs must be captured by the internal representation of documents, and the used similarity measure. In most applications the vector space model and the cosine similarity are used therefore and serve as good approximations. Nevertheless, influencing similarities between documents is rather hard, since parameter tuning relies heavily on expert knowledge of the underlying algorithms, and the influence of different weighting schemes and similarity measures is not known before. In this paper we present an approach on how to adapt the vector space representation of documents by giving visual feedback to the system. Our approach starts by clustering a corpus of text documents and visualizing the results using multi dimensional scaling techniques. Afterwards, a 2D landscape visualization is shown which can be manipulated by the user. Based on these manipulations the high dimensional representation of the documents is adapted to fit the users need more precisely. Our experiments show that iterating these steps results in an adapted representation of documents and similarities, generating layouts as intended by the user and furthermore increases clustering accuracy. While this paper only investigates the influence on clustering and visualization, the method itself may also be used for increasing classification and retrieval performance since it adapts to the users need of similarity","arnumber":"1698330","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Learning Term Spaces Based on Visual Feedback]]>","partnum":"1698330","pubtitle":"Database and Expert Systems Applications, 2006.

It is a challenge to get the steady-state model for a high order complex nonlinear power plant. Moreover, the model should be adaptive under the changing environment. In this paper, a multi-agent system-based intelligent steady-state model (MAS-ISSM) is presented as an alternative methodology to identify the steady-state model in a large-scale 600 MW thermal power plant. Design of architectures for single agents and an organization of the multi-agent system will be described as the foundation of the intelligent steady-state model (ISSM). The MAS-ISSM will be utilized in the evaluation process and the set-point scheduler to map various control inputs to power and pressure set-points for multiobjective optimization in the power plant.

We find that with the wide-spread use of mobile phones, markets become more efficient as risk and uncertainty are reduced; there is greater market integration; there are gains in productivity and in the Marshallian surplus (sum of consumer and producer surplus); and price dispersion and price fluctuations are reduced. The potential efficiencies are, however, subject to easy access to capital, without which the market remains less efficient than it could be.

A better approach must exploit dynamic context and operator requirements to assure that high-value information flows quickly where it's needed (VIRT) and is processed promptly by recipients. Initial studies have shown that this approach reduces the volume of bits by several orders of magnitude. It also raises the productivity of every operator enormously by assuring each can give immediate attention to truly valued information.

The intrinsic reliability of bumps is independent of other package features, like geometry and materials. Therefore, bump lifetime can be generically assessed for a particular bump system independently of product and package specifics. The investigated bump type must always be seen as part of a system which includes chip pad, under bump metallization (UBM), solder bump and substrate pad with or without barrier layer. Using high temperature storage (HTS) and high current stress experiments the degradation of SnAg bumps due to metal diffusion, formation of intermetallic compounds (IMC's), void formation and electromigration is investigated at accelerated conditions. We found a common activation energy of &sim; 1.0 eV, which rules the temperature dependence of bump degradation both with and without current and for both current directions. Current dependence in the low current range follows a current density exponent of = 1.7, which is close to published data on eutectic SnPb bumps. The test results are extrapolated to estimate operating lifetimes as a function of temperature and current. Conversely, the same data yields the maximum current specification of SnAg bumps as a function of temperature and required lifetime.","arnumber":"1441970","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Reliability of lead-free SnAg solder bumps: influence of electromigration and temperature]]>","partnum":"1441970","pubtitle":"Electronic Components and Technology Conference, 2005.

However, there is an emerging vehicular system configuration where converters are loaded by power converters and a better model for the load is a constant power model. This converter operation appears in multi-converter applications such as advanced sea and undersea vehicles where a main converter has as loads a set of converters operating in closed-loop with tight output voltage regulation. This set of converters present at the input terminals a dynamic behavior similar to a constant power load (CPL) for a range of input voltages and a frequency span that ranges from DC up to the bandwidth of the converters. The primary goal of this paper is the development and extension of a technique for large-signal analysis of power electronic converters operating with constant power loads in sea and undersea vehicles using a phase plane analysis. This proposed approach could be used to present advantages and limitations of different controllers and, based on that analysis, define the selection and synthesis of controllers to achieve the required performance and robustness of the system.","arnumber":"1524694","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Constant power loads and negative impedance instability in sea and undersea vehicles: statement of the problem and comprehensive large-signal solution]]>","partnum":"1524694","pubtitle":"Electric Ship Technologies Symposium, 2005 IEEE","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1524694","epage":"320","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1524694&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"1390","punumber":"10225","publicationid":"1524694","doi":"10.1109\/ESTS.2005.1524694"},{"isbn":"1-4244-0759-1","py":"2006","spage":"26","abstract":"Currently, the voltages of power supply on electric vehicle are far higher than the level that people can endure.

Thus understanding transient thermal and electrical behavior of the device, besides the steady-state behavior, is important in order to investigate the global device performance. The major objective of this work is to describe the transient behavior of TEG operating in high temperature environments through a SPICE model based on an electrothermal analogy. The SPICE model presented is derived from a one dimensional (1-D) heat transfer differential equation. An important feature of the model is its ability to calculate the temperature profile taking the real temperature dependence of the materials properties into account. This feature is essential in simulating TEG exposed to a large temperature difference. In combination with considering the finite heat transfer rate at the interface between TEG and thermal ambient, the model is able to reflect the thermo-electric coupled multi-field system effect of TEG. A test rig is developed for verifying the proposed model. Commercially available TEG is tested with respect to stabilizing time under sharply changed electric load. The preliminary results of experiments and modeling are analyzed. It is expected that the model presented can assist, not only in the optimal design of TEG itself, but also in the evaluation of the whole energy system","arnumber":"4133273","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Transient Behavior Study of Thermoelectric Generators through an Electro-thermal Model Using SPICE]]>","partnum":"4133273","pubtitle":"Thermoelectrics, 2006.

Issues of evolvability make sense not only for biological and evolutionary computation systems, but also in the realms of artifacts, culture, and software systems. Persistence through time with variation (while possibly spreading) is an analogue to variation (with heritability). Thus discrete individual replicators are not strictly necessary for an evolutionary dynamic to take place. Studying identified properties that give biological and artifact evolution the capacity to produce complex adaptive variation could shed light on how to enhance the evolvability of software systems in general and of evolutionary computation in particular. Evolution and evolvability can be compared in different domains. But the evolution of software systems is also very unlike that of biological entities whose existence, persistence, development, and integrity as single individuals is actively maintained by the activity of the entities themselves over a long evolutionary history. Integrity of software systems - i.e. the assumption that they are well-defined, coherent individuals that develop - is presupposed by nearly all software process approaches and limits their effectiveness. Understanding the long-term evolvability of software systems as they undergo \"descent with modification\" thus requires much more than a traditional Darwinian approach.

The further increase of the contribution of D&amp;RES in the peak power balance up to 60 % in accordance with the goals of the European Communities for the year 2010 requires innovative approaches to keep the reliability of the power supply on the actual high level. First of all this requires an extended contribution of D&amp;RES to the system services. New communication facilities are required to provide a decentralized energy management and to ensure the provision of system services by D&amp;RES. In a case study, it is analyzed how the existing infrastructure can be used to build a communication network with different physical communication channels. Further more, the application of communication standards is investigated and in the result the use of the data models and the services of the communication standard IEC 61850 (for substation communication) is recommended. It is shown that the advantageous application of this standard and its subsequent standards IEC 61400-25 for wind power plants and IEC 62350 for dispersed generation requires consistency of all described models. Finally, it becomes clear that the implementation of more communication in the distribution level helps to improve the distribution system management.

For system economic operation, the PV\/battery commitment and dispatch must be optimal.

The indices are then used to analyze the impacts of different hybrid generation structures and RES penetration levels on supply reliability of the system. We investigate the suitability of different reliability assessment schemes and pertaining indices for reliability of hybrid energy sources in SIPS.

For onboard storage electrical systems, DC\/DC converters are usually used to control the power flows in the vehicle. This paper focuses on two different DC\/DC converter applications: high current\/low voltage on the one hand and low current\/high voltage on the other hand. For all power mobile applications, a standard dc\/dc converter is not realizable due to mass and volume constraints. As the inductor is usually the biggest and heaviest component in the system, it is important to develop a new structure allowing the reduction of its size and weight. The chosen technology is based on interleaved channels operating in discontinuous mode, also using reverse conduction of power MOSFET transistors. For both of the cases described above, a prototype has been built composed of 8 and 4 channels respectively. The first converter is used for power assistance (250 A\/18 V) using the MOS reverse conduction property. In this particular case, efficiency is up to 96.3 %. The second is developed for a mobile solar application (3.8 A\/270 V). Efficiencies are up to 98.4 %","arnumber":"4025582","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[High Efficient Interleaved Multi-channel dc\/dc Converter Dedicated to Mobile Applications]]>","partnum":"4025582","pubtitle":"Industry Applications Conference, 2006. 41st IAS Annual Meeting.

In order to have high-power density, the converter can be designed to operate in discontinuous conducting mode (DCM) such that the passive inductor can be minimized. The DCM associated current ripple can be alleviated by multiphase interleaved operation. However DCM operation tends to increase turn-off loss because of a high peak current and its associated parasitic ringing due to the oscillation between the inductor and the device output capacitance. Thus the efficiency is suffered with the conventional DCM operation. Although to reduce the turn-off loss, a lossless capacitor snubber can be added across the switch, the energy stored in the capacitor needs to be discharged before device is turned on in order to realize zero-voltage switching. This paper adopts a gate signal complimentary control scheme to turn on the non-active switch and divert the current into the anti-paralleled diode of the active switch so that the main switch can turn on under zero-voltage condition. Thus both soft switching turn-on and turn-off are achieved. This diverted current also eliminates the parasitic ringing in inductor current. For capacitor value selection, there is a trade-off between turn-on and turn-off losses. This paper suggests the optimization of capacitance selection through a series of hardware experiments to ensure the overall power loss minimization under complimentary DCM operating condition. A 100 kW hardware prototype is constructed and tested.

To work on these topics, it is necessary to use methods of mathematical modeling of electrochemical processes in porous media, as well as mathematical methods of solutions of problems of optimal control. In addition, an experimental verification of mathematical findings is necessary. To do this, it is proposed to elaborate methods for obtaining of carbon fibrous materials with given properties, such as, for example with given electrical conductivity.","arnumber":"1507647","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Optimal control of oxidation-reduction processes in electrochemical reactors with flowing volumetric porous electrodes.

However, previous evaluations of these systems have revealed a significant paradox. Mandatory systems that strictly enforce speed limits, while effective, face significant consumer acceptance hurdles. Moreover, young male drivers, who would benefit the most from ISA, tend to be the most negatively disposed towards these systems. Voluntary and advisory systems, on the other hand, are more acceptable to drivers. However, these systems are significantly less effective in reducing speeding. In addition to the tradeoff between effectiveness and acceptability, there is also significant concern that ISA systems may, in fact, have an adverse affect on roadway safety. This paper reviews the research that has been conducted on ISA, and presents possible strategies to maximize both effectiveness and acceptability and mitigate deleterious effects on roadway safety","arnumber":"1706761","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Managing Effectiveness and Acceptability in Intelligent Speed Adaptation Systems]]>","partnum":"1706761","pubtitle":"Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference, 2006.

To provide flight crews with a challenging task that might provide insight into some interesting cockpit human factors issues of airborne separation, artificially high traffic densities and high conflict rates were required. This called for a simulation platform scalable to meet the traffic needs and flexible enough to model the interaction of aircraft in this new environment.

The shunt inverter can serve electric power to the customer and keep the harmonic current from flowing into the power system whereas the series inverter can compensate the voltage events such as voltage sag, swell, and interruption. Because DGs are interconnected with the electric power system, DGs should have countermeasures against disturbances from the electric power system.

An algorithm of a new three-phase power flow calculation is introduced, and numerical examples are shown for a FRIENDS (flexible reliable and intelligent electrical energy delivery system) network, which has single-phase DGs and many loops.","arnumber":"1465690","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Three-phase power flow for FRIENDS network]]>","partnum":"1465690","pubtitle":"Circuits and Systems, 2005.

We initially assume each robot's path is specified and decompose it into collision segments and collision-free segments. The collision avoidance constraints for pairs of robots and the dynamics constraints can then be combined to formulate the coordination problem as a mixed integer nonlinear program (MINLP). In this paper, we first show convexity of the constraints for an individual robot path segment under certain assumptions. We next establish that we are guaranteed to find the global optimum of the MINLP because each subproblem of the MINLP is a convex program, based on the convexity result on individual robot segments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result on directly obtaining the global optimum coordination of multiple (more than two) robots with dynamics constraints. Finally, we extend these results to the task of coordinating robots on a given roadmap, where the roadmap has multiple candidate paths for each robot. We present an approach to simultaneously select each robot's traversal path and generate its continuous velocity profile. These robot velocity profiles satisfy the dynamics constraints, avoid collisions, and globally minimize the completion time. We use the MINLP Solver [25], which combines a branch-and-bound algorithm with a filterSQP algorithm, to solve the MINLP coordination problems. We illustrate the approach with multiple robot coordination examples with up to 156 collision zones.","arnumber":"1570530","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Coordinating Multiple Double Integrator Robots on a Roadmap: Convexity and Global Optimality]]>","partnum":"1570530","pubtitle":"Robotics and Automation, 2005.

The integrated drive system employs a five-leg inverter to power a three-phase traction PM motor and a two-phase compressor PM motor by tying the common terminal of the two-phase motor to the neutral point of the three-phase motor. Compared to a standalone three-phase or two-phase inverter, it eliminates one phase leg and shares the control electronics between the two drives, thus significantly reducing the component count of the compressor drive. To demonstrate that the speed and torque of the two PM motors can be controlled independently, a control strategy was implemented in a digital signal processor, which includes a rotor flux field orientation based control (RFOC) for the three-phase motor, a similar RFOC and a position sensorless control in the brushless dc (BLDC) mode for the two-phase motor. Control implementation issues unique to a two-phase PM motor are also discussed.

The vehicle would spin and lose the control trace of the driver if the traction force is greater than the friction force. Therefore, a vehicle should maintain an adequate slip ratio of the tires and follow the control trace of the driver. This paper described a fuzzy controller for hybrid traction control system in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) that prevented the spinning of the drive wheels during take-off and acceleration through targeted, brief brake impulses in motor torque. The task is to have the fuzzy supervisory controller generate the electric brake torque, for motor of a HEV. The electric brake torque is treated as reference input regenerative braking torque, for lower level control modules. When these lower level motor controller tracks its reference input, the desired slip ratio, can be reduced. Emergency lane change, tire slip ratio change simulations and experimental results were performed to show the effectiveness of the control.

An accurate supply and load forecast would also be a useful tool in ensuring the system stability and reliability when the supply and load can be predicted with higher accuracy. Furthermore, artificial intelligence could play an important role here when the controllable supply and loads can be regulated to promote energy efficiency and system stability.

With the advent of the programmable Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), it is now possible and even profitable to move many application-specific computations to be carried out by the GPU. It has been shown that modern GPUs outperform the standard PC-platform CPUs on a broad class of computations by over a factor of seven. Given the low costs and high processing speeds of GPUs, there is a trend towards using clusters of CPU\/GPU systems. Configuring and programming these clusters for efficient distribution of data and computations is a major challenge. What are the computations that can be offloaded from the CPU to a GPU? The answer to this question is not simple as it depends on the following four factors: GPU's processing capacity, GPU's internal bandwidth, GPU-CPU communication bandwidth and the external network bandwidth. All these factors are subject to change with every generation of hardware. But additions and alternatives to the traditional data-parallel architectures are now needed to exploit the full capability of such clusters using functional parallelism. In this paper, we present a number of architectural configurations that could be adapted on such clusters. Specifically, we demonstrate use of one such architecture: application of a GPU-based pipelined architecture to our work on real-time processing and rendering of large-point datasets which demands complex computations. We have also introduced a list of application and system parameters that are necessary to determine an optimal distribution of computation on the GPUs of a graphics cluster.","arnumber":"1419836","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Functionality Distribution for Parallel Rendering]]>","partnum":"1419836","pubtitle":"Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium, 2005.

Because of the limitation of DC bus, it is difficult to obtain perfect performance in high speed with traditional square current advanced. This paper presents a method of field-weakening control with square current based on instantaneous power theory, in order to handle difficulty of high density PMBM in high speed. Differ to traditional phase advance of square current for field-weakening control of PMBM, instantaneous power theory for field-weakening control can easily obtain wider speed range and good performance, without change current wave and without complex vector transform. This method takes control strategy includes two sides: maxim torque per ampere control method in low speed field and constant power field-weakening control in high speed Held.

The movement was observed above the SiO<inf>2<\/inf>-coated microscopic slide with two chrome electrodes, in which a gap between electrodes ranged from 1 to 10 mm and the voltages were applied at 0.5 to 10 V. When the voltage exceeded 3 V regardless of the gaps, F-actin moved toward a positive electrode. The velocity was directly proportional to the voltage for all gaps of 1, 2, 5 and 10 mm. At less than 3 V, F-actin stayed at the same point, i.e. the Brownian motion. When the gap narrowed from 10 to 1 mm, the velocity increased. Four gaps of 1, 2, 5 and 10 mm had the similar velocity as a function of electric field corresponding to electrophoretic mobility. The velocity was not significantly affected by changes in pH from 6.5 to 8.4 as well as in ionic strength from 25 to 100 mM KCl. The result indicates that the electrode fabrication of the SiO<inf>2<\/inf>surface is useful for the field-induced control of the velocity and direction in F-actin.

We checked that the system can always supply high-quality electricity regardless of the condition of the AC upstream line and that it can assure the electricity quality of an AC upstream line when a distributed power supply is run independently. In addition, we built a DC distribution network and tried a DC 300 V distribution. DC distribution has conventionally been used for communication facilities at 48 V, but this voltage is too low to supply large-capacity electricity. Electric power can be distributed on a macro scale and distribution losses can be reduced by using a voltage of 300 V, but measures must be taken for safety. Therefore, we used a semiconductor switch in a protective device for DC 300 V distribution. We checked that it shorted the parallel circuit within about 1.0 mus of excess current being detected.

Using precision real-time GPS and a sensor controlled flight management system, the system will be able to fly predefined paths with great precision. The expected performance of the flight control system will constrain the flight path to be within a 10 m diameter tube about the desired flight track.

The radar will be fully polarimetric, with a range bandwidth of 80 MHz (2 m range resolution), and will support a 16 km range swath. The antenna will be electronically steered along track to assure that the antenna beam can be directed independently, regardless of the wind direction and speed. Other features supported by the antenna include elevation monopulse and pulse-to-pulse re-steering capabilities that will enable some novel modes of operation.

The harmonic current generated by nonlinear loads on each bus has been measured and applied to calculate the total harmonic distortion (THD). To alleviate the overload and provide the reactive power compensation for the feeder, the photovoltaic generation stations (PVGS) have been considered to connect to the feeder through a three-phase DC\/AC converter drive. To investigate the impact of PVGS on the harmonic distortion for the feeder, the power generation and harmonic current produced by the PVGS have been recorded. With various capacities of PVGS connecting to the feeder, the harmonic distortion has been derived by performing the harmonic power flow analysis. Because the harmonic current introduced by PVGS is much smaller as compared to that generated by the existing distribution loads, the PVGS can be used to regulate the bus voltage very well without causing serious harmonic distortion if the proper filters are considered for the reactive power compensation.","arnumber":"4116044","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Harmonic Analysis for the Distribution System with Dispersed Generation Systems]]>","partnum":"4116044","pubtitle":"Power System Technology, 2006.

The calculation result shows that the dynamics of the EB around the needle tip is different in comparison with that of the region down stream of the flow. These are classified into the large electric field region (around the needle tip) and the weak electric field region (down stream of the flow). In the weak electric field region, the EB becomes an unpredictable random motion and the EB dynamics is dominated by the liquid flow. The dynamics of the EB near the needle tip primarily contributes to the spray current. The space charge inside the nozzle brings the EBs outwards near the nozzle surface from its central region.

Also, the efficiency are improved due to reduced number of switches and batteries, as well as no low frequency isolation transformer is required to realize bypass operation because of the common neutral connection. Both stages of the proposed circuit operate in high frequency, using a passive nondissipative snubber circuit in the boost converter and IGBTs switches in the double half bridge inverter, with low conduction losses, low tail current and low switching losses.

We present a means to interoperate when terminologies differ by presenting an algebra over ontologies. Those ontologies cover terms used in the descriptive metadata and within the data files themselves. Use of the concepts in our approach involves two phases: compiling the terminological matches, using expert-mediated tools, and executing interoperation processes, focused on a specific application subsequently.","arnumber":"1612482","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Dealing with semantic interoperation of data]]>","partnum":"1612482","pubtitle":"Local to Global Data Interoperability - Challenges and Technologies, 2005","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1612482","epage":"144","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1612482&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"1584","punumber":"10733","publicationid":"1612482","doi":"10.1109\/LGDI.2005.1612482"},{"isbn":"978-1-4244-0578-7","py":"2006","spage":"28","abstract":"Thermoelectric power generators can convert thermal energy directly to electrical energy.

Hence it does save energy, which is conventionally wasted by a braking resistor. In addition, the large engine generator is replaced by the much smaller one, for the supercapacitor reduces high power demands away from it. For power conversion between the supercapacitor and the DC link, a 3 legs bidirectional DC-DC converter, which has the same structure as the commercially available 3-phase inverter, is used.

In order to have superior performance, these multi-converter systems need to be rigorously regulated. Dynamic response of tightly regulated power electronic converters in distributed power electronic systems is similar to the dynamic response of a constant power load (CPL), which acts as negative impedance and destabilizes the DC bus and the system. In order to mitigate the instability problem in multi-converter systems, in this paper, we present a novel digital technique to control DC\/DC converters driving CPLs in vehicular systems. The proposed method achieves the output voltage regulation based on generating high and low power pulses instead of conventional pulse width modulation (PWM) techniques. It is simple, straight forward, and easy to implement in specifically designed integrated circuits (IC), digital signal processors (DSP), or field programmable gate arrays (FPGA). Moreover, its dynamic response is fast and robust. Simulation results of applying the proposed method to a DC\/DC buck-boost converter confirm the analytical results.","arnumber":"4778662","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Control and Stabilization of DC\/DC Buck-Boost Converters Loaded by Constant Power Loads in Vehicular Systems using a Novel Digital Scheme]]>","partnum":"4778662","pubtitle":"Power Electronics and Motion Control Conference, 2006.

Many event recognition methods require highly accurate tracking, and may fail when tracks corresponding to event actors are fragmented or partially missing. However, these conditions occur frequently from occlusions, traffic and tracking errors. Recently, methods have been proposed for linking track fragments from multiple objects under these difficult conditions. Here, we develop a method for solving these two problems jointly. A hypothesized event model, represented as a Dynamic Bayes Net, supplies data-driven constraints on the likelihood of proposed track fragment matches. These event-guided constraints are combined with appearance and kinematic constraints used in the previous track linking formulation. The result is the most likely track linking solution given the event model, and the highest event score given all of the track fragments. The event model with the highest score is determined to have occurred, if the score exceeds a threshold. Results demonstrated on a busy scene of airplane servicing activities, where many non-event movers and long fragmented tracks are present, show the promise of the approach to solving the joint problem.","arnumber":"1640949","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Joint Recognition of Complex Events and Track Matching]]>","partnum":"1640949","pubtitle":"Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2006 IEEE Computer Society Conference on","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1640949","epage":"1622","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1640949&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"1597","punumber":"10924","publicationid":"1640949","doi":"10.1109\/CVPR.2006.160"},{"isbn":"1-4244-0158-5","py":"2006","spage":"1","abstract":"Since they are potentially more efficient and simpler in construction, as well as being easier to integrate, electromechanical actuation systems are being considered as an alternative to hydraulic systems for controlling clutches and gearshifts in vehicle transmissions.

Feature vectors representing model object contours from several points of view around each object are acquired and stored. At recognition time, the indexing vectors with the highest match probability are retrieved from the model image database, using a search strategy that employs knowledge-based (KB) search criteria.

In fact, technologies in support of post event response capability and, in the case of terrorism, attribution, have been the key drivers in funding and policy. Unfortunately, the technologies, and methodologies, used to detect chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high explosive (CBRNE) weapons have not fundamentally changed in many years. Although there has been some confirmation of rogue nations and terrorists attempts to obtain WMD, there is substantial evidence of the use conventional explosives. While the use of WMD would be catastrophic (High risk, High impact), the difficulty in implementation makes the actual threat minimal compared to the historical and frequent success of terrorist organizations using relatively simple Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) on soft and\/or highly populated targets (Low risk, Low-Medium impact). The benefit or effect from altering the focus, the funding, and changing the current policy toward a better use of current capabilities in detection, communications and decision support, and generation ofnontraditional detection and disruption technologies is improved effectiveness and efficiency of limited specialized personnel assets, decreased response time, maximization of emergency responders effective reach, standardized detection and response methodology, and, ultimately, the possibility of mitigation and pre-emption.","arnumber":"4375888","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Addressing the Threat: An Examination of Science and Technology Policy Addressing Weapons of Mass Destruction]]>","partnum":"4375888","pubtitle":"Technology and Society, 2006.

A DC integrated fight through power (IFTP) system achieves this increased survivability goal through the use of in-line power conversion, where all of the ship service power is delivered to the zonal loads through staged power conversion. A new AC IFTP system is proposed in this paper, which results from the application of the industrial power-conditioning approach to shipboard power systems. The system architecture is presented and survivability modes are analyzed. Two power conditioning devices are vital to the effective operation of the AC IFTP and these are discussed and simulated in detail. After preliminary analysis, the power conditioning centric AC IFTP system promises reduced size and weight as the converter ratings are reduced. Further analysis is required to quantify these tradeoffs between survivability and weight for the AC IFTP system so that actual weight loss can be identified.","arnumber":"1524690","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Improved ship power system - generation, distribution, and fault control for electric propulsion and ship service]]>","partnum":"1524690","pubtitle":"Electric Ship Technologies Symposium, 2005 IEEE","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1524690","epage":"291","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1524690&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"1605","punumber":"10225","publicationid":"1524690","doi":"10.1109\/ESTS.2005.1524690"},{"isbn":"1-4244-0726-5","py":"2006","spage":"2901","abstract":"Electric power steering (EPS) is a trend for power steering system.

This paper proposes a multicriteria optimization model and solution algorithm. Travel distance, expected value and variance of travel time, as well as risk constitute four important criteria in routing. Generalized dynamic programming is used to find nondominated alternate paths for motorists. At the same time, it allows describing the original network in terms of such paths. In so doing, we reduce the dimensionality of network representation. It is on this reduced network that a vehicle routing model with serving priorities is proposed. Such a model finds nondominant tours for service vehicles, dispatching them to the site of the incidents and route them back to the service depot. With a limited fleet of service vehicles, the inclusion of serving priority assures that multiple incidents happening at the same time can be served in accordance with their levels of severity. A preliminary study in Central Arkansas freeways verifies the serviceability of such a model.","arnumber":"1571250","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[A multi-criteria routing model for incident management]]>","partnum":"1571250","pubtitle":"Systems, Man and Cybernetics, 2005 IEEE International Conference on","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1571250","epage":"839 Vol. 1","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1571250&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"1608","punumber":"10498","publicationid":"1571250","doi":"10.1109\/ICSMC.2005.1571250"},{"isbn":"0-7695-2507-5","py":"2006","spage":"160b","abstract":"This paper presents technical foundation, roadmap and initial results of the IDIOM project (Information Diffusion across Interactive Online Media).

Certainly looking at the volume, mass, power and torque of a typical 3 phase induction machine, even in comparison with a typical automobile engine produces some rather disheartening numbers. This paper discusses some fundamental principles as originally presented by Laithwaite, as well as some commonly held beliefs, or rules of thumb. These principles and rules of thumb indicate that the power and torque density (kW\/m<sup>3 <\/sup>, Nm\/m<sup>3<\/sup>), the specific power and the specific torque (kW\/kg, Nm\/kg), and the efficiency must all degrade dramatically as the machine rating goes down. The paper then presents some numbers for existing machines, representing standard, generally available technologies today. The paper then examines some specific designs of special purpose permanent magnet (PM) machines, which produce numbers which appear to confound both the theory and the practice described. Conclusions are deduced that the small induction machine eventually lose its place as the drive of choice in small applications, and be relegated to \"niche\" applications. It is further concluded that this displacement can be justified on cost alone, with dramatic efficiency increases being simply fortuitous additional benefits","arnumber":"1619651","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Why Small Permanent Magnet Machine Drives are Relegating the Induction Machine Drive to Niche Applications]]>","partnum":"1619651","pubtitle":"Power Electronics and Drives Systems, 2005.

However, these environments are single platform, single solver, and based on costly commercial products. The high cost of these systems often makes them infeasible in many applications. To provide an efficient solution for HIL testing, a very low-cost, multi-solver, hard real-time simulation environment, the real-time virtual test bed (VTB-RT), has been developed in the University of South Carolina, completely based on open-source software and off-the-shelf hardware. In previous publications, the VTB-RT has already been successfully applied in many fields, such as real-time simulations, power electronics controls, and digital controller designs. This paper presents a detailed but general implementation procedure of the VTB-RT from the software and hardware points of view. The readers could follow this procedure to build the VTB-RT or their own real-time systems. Besides, in this paper the application of the VTB-RT is extended to motor drive systems, which have even higher time critical requirements. For verification purposes, a well-known DC motor drive system is realized using the VTB-RT and the consistency of the experimental results with the theoretical results proves the reliability of the VTB-RT.","arnumber":"1568910","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Implementation of a low-cost real-time virtue test bed for hardware-in-the-loop testing]]>","partnum":"1568910","pubtitle":"Industrial Electronics Society, 2005.

Many studies have proposed that the twenty-first century will be the age of the knowledge-based economy, but how can the wide spectrum of today's economies all structure their knowledge generating sector to prosper? In general terms, research leadership is the ability to foresee the emerging scientific road and drive the research sector with respect, confidence, loyalty, willing cooperation and commitment to follow that path. It involves focusing the efforts of a group of people toward a common goal and inspiring them to work as a real team. In comparison, research management is the administrative ability that focuses primarily on planning, organizing, and developing processes and methodologies to ensure that the research team effort is effective, efficient and successful. In a research environment, all research managers are not necessarily leaders, but the most effective managers over the long-term may prove to be good leaders as well. Both leadership and management are important because leadership emphasizes communicating the vision and then motivating and inspiring project participants to deliver higher performance, while management focuses on getting things done. The discussion will explore the difference between research leadership and research management and the importance of balancing both to achieve overall economic and social success in the twenty-first century.

In principle, the designed Z-source inverter functions by selectively \"shooting through\" its power sources, coupled to the inverter using two unique Z-source impedance networks, to boost the inverter three-level output waveform. Proper modulation of the new inverter would therefore require careful integration of the selective shoot-through process to the basic switching concepts to achieve maximal voltage-boost, minimal harmonic distortion, lower semiconductor stress and minimal number of device commutations per switching cycle. To date, the theoretical background on Z-source NPC modulation has not been fully established, and it is the theme of this paper to propose a number of enhanced voltage-boost pulse-width modulation (PWM) strategies for controlling the Z-source NPC inverter. While developing the PWM techniques, attention has been devoted to carefully derive them from a common generic basis for improved portability, easier implementation, and most importantly, assisting readers in understanding all concepts that have been presented.

Normally, high resolution sensors for position measurement do not meet the robustness requirements for vehicles. In view of robustness and reliability, speed sensorless methods like EMF-based observers are favored for motor control in such applications. Because these observers do not work near zero speed, an additional method is necessary to cover the full speed range. Unfortunately, methods using injection of additional signals do not fulfil the reliability and noise specifications in automotive applications so that speed sensors are still used as standard solution for these electrical drives. In this paper, a novel dual-mode position estimation structure is presented, which uses a robust, low resolution position sensor near zero speed. At normal speed, sensorless EMF-based principles are applied. The proposed method enables a smooth transition between the low speed operation and the fully sensorless operation.

At present, the broader power electronics technology base is drifting without direction and unless the industry and associated academic researchers can cooperate, pooling resources, it will not be possible to offer a workable alternative to the very mature existing technologies. Basically, the power industry continues to rely on the evolution of the microelectronics industry for advancements in power electronics technology. A strong common technology roadmap could change this. When applied correctly, technology roadmapping can encourage firms, R&amp;D organisations, governments and industries to develop a shared vision of the future, explore the opportunities and pathways to achieve it and develop creative solutions to the technology issues and research needs identified. By sharing pre-competitive technologies and knowledge, firms can leverage financial and intellectual resources to achieve market success.

This novel digital control treats converter as a digital system and regulates output voltage with the help of two predefined state variables. This method uses high-power and low-power duty cycles instead of traditional PWM, to regulate the output voltage of converter. The constant power load behaviour is valid up to a certain frequency. An ideal constant power load is somehow the worst case, and for this reason the studies are done in the worst case.

Key to designs which optimally exploit these feasible regions: a software-automated catalog of results from the mathematics of connectivity. For example, discoveries about Hamming graphs set the stage for algorithms that configure the corresponding topologies. We introduce a new theorem that explicates the separability-covering duality of Hamming graphs, together with a new, efficient algorithm for recognizing and labeling Hamming graphs of arbitrary radix and dimension. Previously reported algorithms run slower, and emphasize Hamming graphs with radix two.

The methods are proposed through experimental and theoretical analyses of EMI noises appearing in the EV drive systems. The analyzed results show that there are two kinds of EMI noises in EV drive systems. One is differential mode noises appearing due to series resonance phenomena in the DC circuit between batteries and inverters at the time of switching operations. The produced noises are diffused into the body frame via stray capacitors between the inverter and car body frames as a common mode current. The other kind is EMI noises caused by surges appearing at motor terminals. They cause another common mode current that diffuses into the body frame via the motor shaft. The surface currents appearing on the body frame through these diffusion processes induce radiations around the body frame which cause electromagnetic interference between EVs. One method is proposed that controls differential mode noises including radiations induced by them; it uses a multilayer printed power circuit technique. Another method is proposed that prevents radiations induced by the common mode current produced due to surges occurring at motor terminals by suppressing series resonance phenomena occurring in common current paths.

Thus the overall conversion efficiency is strongly dependent on spatial variations of the material properties according to the temperature profile along the entire thermoelectric generator element. Similarly, a functionally graded module is capable of accomplishing thermal sensors with linearised characteristics over a wide temperature range. The Seebeck-coefficient S is a measure of the electrically active components in a material. Different components in a single unit become visible by measuring the local S with a scanning thermoprobe. This applies accordingly for the electrical conductivity and therefore the behaviour of the material in a certain temperature gradient becomes predictable. A scanning Seebeck microprobe has been combined with the measurement of the electric potential along the surface of semiconducting or metallic material. A heated probe tip is placed onto the surface of the sample under investigation, measuring the Seebeck coefficient. Using a specially designed sample holder, an AC current can be applied to the specimen, allowing for the detection of the voltage drop between one current contact and the travelling probe tip. This voltage is proportional to the electrical conductivity at the tip position. With this technique a spatially resolved imaging of the Seebeck coefficient as well as the electrical conductivity can be performed. Furthermore the electrical contact resistance between different materials becomes visible, e.g., in segmented thermoelectric or other devices.","arnumber":"1519875","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Potential-Seebeck-microprobe (PSM): measuring the spatial resolution of the Seebeck coefficient and the electric potential]]>","partnum":"1519875","pubtitle":"Thermoelectrics, 2005.

The effect on event recognition is revealed by examining the event model match score as a function of lock score threshold. Using a dynamic Bayesian network to model events, it is shown that event recognition actually improves with greater track fragmentation, assuming fragmented tracks for the same object are linked together. The improvement continues up to a point when it is more likely to be offset by other errors such as those caused by frequent object reinitialization.

In addition this paper proposes two interleaved boost rectifiers, one in a HBR version and the other in a FBR version. These topologies alleviate the current stress and inductor size problems present in the both HBR and FBR. Besides the theoretical analysis of the proposed topologies the paper presents a quantitative study of the inductor size and input current ripple reduction when compared to the basic HBR and FBR topologies. The IFBR reduces of 50% the inductor size, the semiconductor current stress, and the switching losses with respect to the UVM option as applied to FBR Also, the IHBR topology reduces the inductor size to less than 25% and the semiconductor current stress to 50% when compared to the basic HBR. The two proposed topologies are suitable for high power applications. Simulated and experimental results confirm the theoretical analysis.","arnumber":"1620551","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Reducing the inductor size and current stress by interleaved bidirectional boost rectifiers used for power factor correction]]>","partnum":"1620551","pubtitle":"Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition, 2006.

Simulation results by DMRM incorporate saturation and slotting effects. Short circuit current is difficult to limit due to the uncontrolled permanent magnet produced field. Permanent magnets are also prone to demagnetization due to the compound effect of the demagnetising MMF produced by the high short circuit current together with the armature reaction MMF. Shorting small numbers of turns gives very little time before further failures could occur. Shorts of large numbers of turns change machine flux levels, saturation and torque constant.

However, this concept, called reversible computing, imposes tight constraints on the design of the machine at all levels from physics to algorithms.

This work is part of the ongoing FreedomCAR and Vehicle Technologies (FCVT) program, performed for the Department of Energy (DOE). Removal of the heat generated from electrical losses in traction motors and their associated power electronics is essential for the reliable operation of motors and power electronics. As part of a larger thermal management project, which includes shrinking inverter size and direct cooling of electronics, ORNL has developed U.S. Patent No. 6,772,603 B2, Methods and apparatus for thermal management of vehicle systems and components (Hsu et al, 2004), and patent pending Floating loop system for cooling integrated motors and inverters using hot liquid refrigerant (Hsu et al, 2004). The floating-loop system provides a large coefficient of performance (COP) for hybrid drive component cooling. This loop uses R-134a as a coolant and shares the vehicle's existing air-conditioning (AC) condenser, which dissipates waste heat to the ambient air. Because temperature requirements for cooling power electronics and electric machines are not as low as that required for passenger compartment air, this adjoining loop can operate on the high-pressure side of the existing AC system. This arrangement also allows for the floating loop to run without a compressor and requires only a small pump to move the liquid refrigerant. For the design to be viable, the loop must not adversely affect the existing system. The loop should also, ideally, provide a high COP, a flat temperature profile, and low pressure drop. To date, the floating-loop test prototype has successfully removed 2 kW of heat load in a 9 kW automobile passenger AC system with and without the automotive AC system running. However, during the cyclic operation of the floating refrigerant loop, some two- - -phase transient behavior is evident. In order to maintain stable running conditions, specific operating controls were implemented. Also thermodynamic energy balances were conducted to further analyze the operating conditions","arnumber":"1625217","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Operating controls and dynamics for floating refrigerant loop for high heat flux electronics]]>","partnum":"1625217","pubtitle":"Semiconductor Thermal Measurement and Management Symposium, 2006 IEEE Twenty-Second Annual IEEE","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1625217","epage":"129","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1625217&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"1762","punumber":"10819","publicationid":"1625217","doi":"10.1109\/STHERM.2006.1625217"},{"isbn":"0-7695-2644-6","py":"2006","spage":"8 pp.","abstract":"NASA's 10,240-processor Columbia supercomputer gained worldwide recognition in 2004 for increasing the space agency's computing capability ten-fold, and enabling U.S. scientists and engineers to perform significant, breakthrough simulations.

Recent technology improvements enabled ultracapacitors to be an interesting option for short-term high power applications, such as in industry, automotive and traction drives, regenerative energy systems, medical and telecommunication equipment. However, ultracapacitors offer voltage value at terminals which is almost directly proportional to their state of charge and therefore greatly dependent on the operating condition. A power electronic converter is then required to utilize ultracapacitors in the mentioned applications, and reliable converter topology as well high dynamic control technique should be chosen in order to best operate the ultracapacitor storage unit. In this paper the synergetic synthesis of controllers for a bi-directional half-bridge converter is proposed. Results from both simulations and experimental tests show that the synergetic controllers have faster dynamic behavior with respect to more traditional linear controllers, thus synergetic control theory is particularly suited to synthesize the controllers of power electronic converters for Ultracapacitors. The control laws have been implemented on a fixed-point 16-bits DSP from Analog Devices, whereas a 30 kW half-bridge converter prototype has been used to carry out the experimental testing activity.","arnumber":"1453327","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Synergetic control for ultracapacitors based high dynamic converters]]>","partnum":"1453327","pubtitle":"Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition, 2005.

Several anti-islanding methods have been investigated and classified as passive (measurement of the natural effects of islanding) and active (based on the measurement of the effects due to transients or harmonics deliberately introduced in the system). In case the power drained by the load matches the power generated by the DG inverter the effect of islanding are small and the passive detection methods fail. However the active methods that have been developed to overcome these limits create disturbances that can interact with those generated by other DG systems. In this paper a new anti-islanding method is proposed. It exploits the natural sensitivity to disturbances of a grid voltage sensorless control to highlight islanding condition. The adopted grid voltage sensorless control is adapted to a single-phase system with the use of resonant controllers on the basis of the internal model control law: a resonant controller-based observer results. Then a Kalman-filter-based algorithm is used to detect the islanding condition on the basis of the energy mismatch between the estimated 3<sup>rd<\/sup> and 5<sup>th<\/sup> harmonics and the real ones. Simulation and experimental results support the analysis.","arnumber":"1569299","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Islanding detection method for single-phase distributed generation systems based on inverters]]>","partnum":"1569299","pubtitle":"Industrial Electronics Society, 2005.

The proposed technique to drive the PMSM at CPSR is the dual mode inverter control (DMIC). The main idea behind DMIC is to change the three-phase operation of the PMSM below base speed to single-phase above base speed. This technique allows driving the PMSM in a wide CPSR. The DMIC uses three facts to achieve wide CPSR. First, it introduces the idea of the advance angle, which allows driving current into the machine while the back-emf is smaller than the DC link voltage.

Running networked graphics applications in mobile environments faces a fundamental conflict; graphics applications require large amounts of memory, CPU cycles, battery power and disk space, while mobile devices and wireless channels tend to be limited in these resources. In order to mitigate mobile environment issues, some form of adaptation based on a client device's capabilities, prevailing wireless network conditions, characteristics of the graphics application and user preference, is necessary. In this paper, we describe the mobile adaptive distributed graphics framework (MADGRAF), a graphics-aware middleware architecture that makes it feasible to run complex 3D graphics applications on low end mobile devices over wireless networks. In MADGRAF, a server can perform mobile device-optimized pre-processing of complex graphics scenes in order to speed up run time rendering, scale high-resolution meshes using polygon or image-based simplification, progressively transmit compressed graphics files, conceal transmission errors by including redundant bits or perform remote execution, all tailored to the client's capabilities.

Corrective maintenance involving replacement or repair after a failure is also expensive because of down time. In this paper, we present discriminant analysis and stepwise discriminant analysis for vibration prognostics. The goal is prediction of failures in drive train components of helicopters, specifically tail rotor drive shaft or engine input shaft. The method has been applied to make predictions of vibrations in the main rotor shaft of Sikorsky helicopter UH-60, using Goodrich Health and Usage Management System (HUMS). The purpose of these predictions is to help enforce rotor vibrations below a threshold to avoid component damages and to reduce aircrew fatigue. The method is particularly useful for prediction of no increase of vibration. This is an important contribution because drive train components of helicopters are normally very robust, thereby the cost of unnecessary preventive maintenance is very high.

For inverter-based DG systems, phase shift anti-islanding techniques such as slide mode shift (SMS), automatic phase shift (APS), active frequency drift (AFD), and active frequency drift with positive feedback (AFDPF) have been proposed because of their effectiveness in preventing most of the islanding cases. However, existing phase shift techniques are all based on the assumption that at a grid failure, the voltage frequency of the inverter can be driven by its output current in a desired direction, up or down, until the inverter's frequency is drifted into the over frequency relay and under frequency relay (OFR\/UFR) window. However, when the quality factor of the local loads is high, traditional phase shift mechanisms may not work as desired, instead, the frequency of the inverter could oscillate around a certain frequency point after islanding occurs. This is due to the high ratio of the energy stored in and the energy consumed in the local load. To solve this problem, a total frequency deviation (TFD) in a moving time frame is introduced as the islanding index while using adaptive logic phase shift (ALPS) as the basic phase-shift motivation. The TFD value becomes significantly large after the islanding happens. The TFD value can interact with ALPS algorithm to move the frequency of the inverter continuously until it reaches the OFR\/UFR tripping window. Both simulation and lab tests have demonstrated the highly effectiveness of this anti-islanding algorithm","arnumber":"1556995","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[A new total frequency deviation algorithm for anti-islanding protection in inverter-based DG systems]]>","partnum":"1556995","pubtitle":"Electrical and Computer Engineering, 2005.

On the other hand, active approaches have smaller non-detection zone, but these active approaches inevitably have negative impact on inverter's performance. To solve these problems, a new hybrid of both passive and active anti-islanding algorithm is proposed in this paper. A covariance index is used as a passive indicator to activate an active anti-islanding action, adaptive reactive power shift action, which can intelligently vary the output reactive power of the DG system to realize the anti-islanding protections.

This work is part of the ongoing FreedomCAR and Vehicle Technologies program (FCVT), performed for the Department of Energy (DOE). Removal of the heat generated from electrical losses in traction motors and their associated power electronics is essential for the reliable operation of motors and power electronics. As part of a larger thermal management project, which includes shrinking inverter size and direct cooling of electronics, ORNL has developed U.S. Patent No. 6,772,603 B2, Methods and Apparatus for Thermal Management of Vehicle Systems and Components (Hsu, 2004), and patent pending floating loop system for cooling integrated motors and inverters using hot liquid refrigerant (Hsu, 2004). The floating-loop system provides a large coefficient of performance (COP) for hybrid-electric drive component cooling. This loop (based on R-134a) shares a vehicle's existing air-conditioning (AC) condenser, which dissipates waste heat to the ambient air. Because the temperature requirements for cooling of power electronics and electric machines are not as low as that required for passenger compartment air, this adjoining loop can operate on the high-pressure side of the existing AC system. This arrangement also allows for the floating loop to run without the need for the compressor and only needs a small pump to move the liquid refrigerant. For the design to be viable, the loop must not adversely affect the existing system. The loop would also provide a high COP, a flat temperature profile, and a low pressure drop. The floating-loop test prototype has been successfully integrated into a 9 kW automobile passenger AC system. In this configuration, the floating loop has been tested up to 2 kW of heat rejected during operation with and without the automotive A- - C system running. The floating-loop system has demonstrated a very respectable COP of 40-45, as compared to a typical AC system COP of about 2-4. The estimated required waste-heat load for future HEV cooling applications is 5.5 kW, and the existing system should be easily scalable to this larger load","arnumber":"1625207","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Fundamentals of a floating loop concept based on R134a refrigerant cooling of high heat flux electronics]]>","partnum":"1625207","pubtitle":"Semiconductor Thermal Measurement and Management Symposium, 2006 IEEE Twenty-Second Annual IEEE","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1625207","epage":"64","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1625207&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"1836","punumber":"10819","publicationid":"1625207","doi":"10.1109\/STHERM.2006.1625207"},{"isbn":"1-4244-0177-1","py":"2006","spage":"1904","abstract":"In this paper a new method for placement of DG (distributed generation) units in distribution networks has been presented.

While this generally offers an adequate solution; test time, cost and schedule can often be reduced and better solutions can be obtained by incorporating computational electromagnetic (CEM) and cosite modeling into the antenna integration process. Modeling and simulation compliments field-testing in a hybrid approach. Analysis of extensive and complicated scenarios that are not easily field-testable can often be effectively simulated. Additionally, modeling allows for multiple variations of a test scenario to expand the solution space and show causal relationships between test entities (antenna-to-antenna or antenna-to-platform). This type of analysis can be used to answer \"what-if\" questions, thus providing new insight into test results. On the other hand, electromagnetic and cosite modeling is not a stand-alone practice. Field-testing is a critical component to the hybrid approach in that it incorporates the totality of a system in the testing process. In many cases the models may be simplified or given more detail based on collected field-test data. Field-testing also plays an important role in model validation and is extremely valuable as the final proof of the integrated solution.

Therefore Monte Carlo (MC) simulations have been utilized for template generation. The GEANT4 toolkit provides the benefits of an open source program with easy access to appropriate material and radioactive decay data, considering all relevant physical processes. However, dedicated computing techniques had to be applied in order to obtain the necessary (statistical) accuracy at a justifiable computing time. The implemented models have also been used to study the influence of detector size and material, source mantling or matrix, and detector-source geometry on the measured gamma ray spectrum.","arnumber":"4178988","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Simulation of Template Spectra for Scintillator Based Radionuclide Identification Devices Using GEANT4]]>","partnum":"4178988","pubtitle":"Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record, 2006.

By selecting appropriate phase shifts between the primary and secondary sides of the transformers and synchronously switching the three-phase bridges at specified phase relations, low order harmonics can be eliminated in pairs. Thus a very high power quality voltage waveform can be synthesized using low switching frequencies.

This is even more critical when the power converter is only a small part of a large system under study. A model based on mathematical equations derived under ideal conditions could be used, but the need to consider secondary effects such as continuous and discontinuous current or current commutation make this method much complicated due to the multiple modes of power converter operation. A regression based behavioral model was developed using a \"design of experiment\" (DOE) approach with very good statistical fit. This reduces simulation time drastically capturing also those aspects of the 12-pulse converter that are not normally included in models using other simplifications.

We propose the scheme phase-loop-lock based CDR block with jitter reduction block in which the PAM4 signal is detected by each transition and converted to a binary signal. The proposed jitter reduction block consists of a differentiator, three comparators, monostable multivibrators and a decision block, while CDR part incorporates a phase and frequency detector, a loop filter and a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO). Due to the acquisition of each transition data, jitter is reduced and locking time for CDR is also reduced. We evaluate the system level architecture with PAM4 10 Gb\/s signal and behavioral simulation.","arnumber":"1530923","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[A novel clock recovery scheme with improved jitter tolerance for PAM4 signaling]]>","partnum":"1530923","pubtitle":"System-on-Chip for Real-Time Applications, 2005.

Faults are malfunctions that are observed in the monitoring system. Two types of errors can occur during automated fault detection: (1) missed detections or (2) false alarms. The practical consequence of either type of error is that a failed component may not be replaced when necessary, or alternatively, may be unnecessarily serviced due to a false alarm. In the most catastrophic cases of incorrect fault detection, the outcome may include the loss of an expensive military asset, or human life. The false alarm problem is particularly troublesome for condition based maintenance and prognostics problems where fault signatures necessarily need to be detected at lower levels. Here, we present an overview of some of the vagaries of fault and anomaly detection in the framework of reducing false alarms. New algorithmic approaches to user-controllable false alarm rates are presented, followed by a dose of pragmatism, as real-world false alarm mitigation on a currently-deployed military aircraft is described","arnumber":"1656101","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[On false alarm mitigation]]>","partnum":"1656101","pubtitle":"Aerospace Conference, 2006 IEEE","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1656101","epage":"","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1656101&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"1867","punumber":"11012","publicationid":"1656101","doi":"10.1109\/AERO.2006.1656101"},{"isbn":"1-4244-0121-6","py":"2006","spage":"1552","abstract":"This paper deals with the design, analysis and simulation of wind turbine associated with a storage unit to generate a constant active power through the grid for all wind conditions.

It is becoming essential for firms to constantly develop the new products into markets. Technology roadmaps, therefore, are considered to be efficient, effective tool of connecting both product and technology planning's collectively, thus being widely accepted by firms. However, those roadmaps and their methodologies hitherto proposed generally tend to have overstated the qualitative, expert-dependent knowledge rather than incorporating objective information. In addition, useful methodologies are often observed to lack, to facilitate a large variety of decision-makings faced in roadmapping processes. Consequently, this paper proposes a new approach: keyword-based technology roadmapping method by using the patents which contains relatively objective information, a quantitative method to support the reliable decision-making processes. Hence, text-mining technique is utilized in this study to extract the relevant information on which the portfolio analysis, co-word analysis and network analysis are carried out, resulting in three different types of product-technology maps. Also, these maps demonstrate the applicability as to where to be applied usefully in a specific step of roadmapping processes. These techniques are highly expected to reflect the objective, quantitative information to roadmapping, and to effectively help improve the overall roadmap quality at the end","arnumber":"4077536","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Using Patent Information for New Product Development: Keyword-Based Technology Roadmapping Approach]]>","partnum":"4077536","pubtitle":"Technology Management for the Global Future, 2006.

A numerical model simulates the operation of the device and facilitates its design. Advanced multi-parameter, gradient-based optimization techniques are used to better understand the interactions between various design variables and parameters in order to progress towards an optimal TPG design. The device, made up of a series of segmented elements each comprised of up to three different materials, combines thermal isolation in the direction of flow with high power density thermoelectric (TE) material integrated directly into the heat exchanger device. Electrical current runs parallel to the heat source and sink surfaces in the device, allowing the integration of the TE material with multiple geometric degrees of freedom. This design attribute coupled with the thermal isolation thermodynamic cycle, allows each element of the TE device to be optimized semi-independently. Each p- and n-type element can have different aspect ratios (cross-sectional area divided by thickness) so that each material layer of each element has the highest possible ZT for each temperature range. The increased design flexibility helps address TE material compatibility issues associated with segmented elements and fluid flow that ordinarily degrade performance. Eliminating the impact of thermal expansion mismatch while still maintaining excellent thermal and electrical contacts is also a design goal. Additional design considerations are also discussed, including electrical and thermal connector design and minimizing interfacial resistances.

In any photovoltaic (PV)-based system, the inverter is a critical component responsible for current control between the PV module, battery, loads and power grid. Inverters, which convert direct to alternating current, can be designed to be used with different voltage ranges and topologies for varying applications, and they can also be designed with or without transformers. Besides DC\/AC conversion, inverters provide additional functions such as maximizing power, battery charging and protecting the circuit. All of these functions require optimized intelligent control that can occur in real time or near-real time; and the wide variations in application and operational requirements mean that the system control has to be highly flexible. Digital signal processor (DSP)-based controllers, such as the Texas Instruments TMS320C2000 family of controllers, provide the high level of computational performance and programming flexibility needed for the real-time signal processing in solar power inverters. Highly integrated digital signal controllers help inverter manufacturers create more efficient, more cost-effective products that can support the growing demand for solar energy in upcoming years","arnumber":"1650038","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Digital Signal Controllers Improve Efficiency for Solar Power Inverters]]>","partnum":"1650038","pubtitle":"Electronics and the Environment, 2006.

Several approaches have been proposed in the previous researches such as slide-mode frequency shift (SMS), active frequency drift (AFD), and active frequency drift with positive feedback (AFDPF) etc. The automatic phase shift (APS) method is actually a modified SMS method. It can effectively reduce the non-detection zone (NDZ) of the SMS technique by introducing an additional phase shift increment each time the frequency of the terminal voltage stabilizes. However, it is very difficult to determine a stable islanding frequency, and the APS algorithm sometimes acts slowly, even fails in certain load conditions. A new adaptive logic phase-shift (ALPS) algorithm is proposed in this paper to regulate the additional phase shift at a suspicious islanding situation and evaluate the effects of the phase shift. This algorithm can yield a quick phase shift in an islanding situation yet only produce a very small phase shift when the grid is available for inverter-based DG systems.

The EA types investigated include barrage noise, chaff tactics, and the use of expendable decoys.

The desired effect of the EA against the RF sensors is degradation of the target track quality, thereby forcing the sensors to use other methods to estimate the target position (e.g., triangulation).

Technologies have been transferred through a variety of means including from trade to theft, leaving history littered with successful and unsuccessful examples of technology transfer through a variety of means. Facing humanity is an unprecedented threat of anthropogenic climate change, the solution to which is to reduce the rate at which greenhouse gasses are building up in our atmosphere and deal with the impacts of climate variability and change. Such an intervention requires a change of both technology and behaviour that reduces the greenhouse gas emissions intensity of energy services. Meanwhile, the development agenda shaped by the Millennium Development Goals to reduce poverty, is gaining buy-in. So the question is, how will the accelerated receipt of cleaner energy technologies be successfully achieved in marginalised communities in developing countries? The paper considers a range of drivers, case studies and projects, that are being undertaken as early Clean Development Mechanism experiments under the banner of the international South South North Group. It discusses the drivers of technology transfer and starts to unpack the elements of successful ownership of the technologies. The paper considers ownership of hardware, software (process) and orgware (institutions) required to advance the diffusion and use of Environmentally Safe Technologies (ESTs) for the provision of energy services. It presents an approach to project selection and development under South South North which attempts to secure successful ownership and receipt of classes of technology that provide services essential for development.","arnumber":"4057372","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Towards a Framework of Clean Energy Technology Receptivity (draft 8)]]>","partnum":"4057372","pubtitle":"EIC Climate Change Technology, 2006 IEEE","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4057372","epage":"11","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4057372&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"1894","punumber":"4057290","publicationid":"4057372","doi":"10.1109\/EICCCC.2006.277242"},{"isbn":"0-4244-0150-X","py":"2005","spage":"1","abstract":"The conceptual design for a heavy ion beam probe diagnostic for the TCV tokamak in Lausanne is presented.

Traditionally, the control system of a domestic boiler is conceived in such a way to regulate simply the water temperature by acting on the gas flow. Actually, in order to improve the quality of the combustion process, it would be necessary to regulate also the quantity of air, and hence of oxygen, in relation to the gas flow. Using a suitable sensor for measuring the percentage of oxygen in the combustion chamber, the actual value of the lambda ratio can be calculated, as well as the excess of air with respect to a reference value depending on the gas used. It is shown that this information can be used efficiently in a feedback control loop in order to regulate, by means of a variable-speed fan, the quantity of air involved in the combustion process.

These include imaging scattering systems and imaging interferometer\/polarimeter systems as well as electron cyclotron emission imaging (ECEI) systems and microwave imaging reflectometry (MIR) systems. For example, a novel 2-D ECEI on the TEXTOR tokamak provides 2-D images with high spatial resolution [128 pixels covering 8 cm (radial) x 16 cm (vertical)], and high temporal resolution (up to ~5 microsec) which have revealed the details of 2-D images of the electron temperature fluctuations during the precursor phase and the crash time of m=1 (sawtooth) oscillations, with a level of detail that is not accessible through conventional methods (1-D ECE and\/or tomography).

Accordingly, novel high radix systolic array Montgomery multiplier designs are presented, as we believe that the inherent regular structure and absence of global interconnect associated with these, make them well-suited for implementation on modern FPGAs. Unlike previous approaches, each processing element (PE) comprises both an adder and a multiplier. The inclusion of a multiplier in the PE means that the need to precompute or store any multiples of the operands is avoided. This also allows very high radix implementations to be realised, further reducing the amount of clock cycles per modular multiplication, while still maintaining a competitive critical delay. For demonstrative purposes, 512 bit and 1024 bit FPGA implementations using radices of 2<sup>8<\/sup> and 2<sup>16 <\/sup> are presented.

Managing this sector is an important priority for addressing global warming, conserving resources and improving energy security. Much energy is wasted in delivering energy services not actually used by residents. Two examples include heating\/cooling and lighting of unoccupied houses and rooms, and overheating or overcooling to make up for temperature variations. IT-enabled monitoring and control technologies have played an important role in eliminating similar kinds of inefficiencies in other sectors, so it is natural to think that these systems could have an important role in the home as well. The technology level of energy control in most homes is at least 20 years old, with simple programmable thermostats still in only about a quarter of US homes. Networked thermostats, power meters and switches, and zone heating are technologies that can provide information on energy use and allow it to be controlled for distribution only when needed. In addition to direct energy savings, there is also a demand to reduce indirect needs for energy infrastructure through peak shifting, or redistributing of electricity demand more evenly throughout the day. In addition to surveying these energy management issues, this article also relates the experience of a pilot project setting up monitoring\/control systems in three Sacramento homes. The design specifications of these systems combine capabilities for Web-based monitoring and control and peak shifting via pre-cooling, and load shedding. The pilot has shown that such a monitoring and control system satisfying the design parameters can be implemented via mainly off-the-shelf parts.

Different computational approaches to study protein folding and protein unfolding have recently become common tools available to the researcher. However, due to the lack of appropriate infrastructures, it is very difficult to directly compare simulations performed by different groups, with different methods, in different experimental conditions or for different proteins. Thus, we set out to create a public data repository with the goal of addressing the problem of comparison, analysis and sharing of information and data on protein folding and protein unfolding simulations. The P-found system for protein folding and protein unfolding simulations is presented. At the moment, the data repository allows uploading of molecular dynamics (MD) protein folding and unfolding simulations, calculates and stores several time series with the variation over time of pre-defined molecular properties, and allows searching and downloading of these data. In the near future, simulations performed by other than MD methods may be uploaded, and data mining techniques for analysis and comparison of multiple simulations will be implemented.

In this paper, we examine an approach that addresses the receiver heterogeneity problem in cellular multicast with the help of an additional IEEE 802.11 ad hoc network. The basic idea is to allow the cellular receivers experiencing poor channel conditions to use the ad hoc network to connect to those cellular receivers that are experiencing good cellular channel conditions. The good receivers (called proxies) relay multicast data to the poor receivers through the ad hoc network. We specifically consider the third generation cellular high data rate (HDR) broadcast\/multicast services (BCMCS). We develop a new routing algorithm to find efficient ad hoc paths from the proxies to the cellular multicast receivers. Unlike existing algorithms (Luo et al. (2003)), our routing algorithm considers the effect of ad hoc path interference. Using simulations of an HDR BCMCS network in conjunction with an IEEE ad hoc network, we show that our algorithm improves the receiver goodput by up to 280% compared to that obtained without using ad hoc paths. We also show that our algorithm achieves up to 98% higher receiver goodput in comparison to the greedy algorithm proposed in Luo.","arnumber":"1424854","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Enhancing cellular multicast performance using ad hoc networks]]>","partnum":"1424854","pubtitle":"Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, 2005 IEEE","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1424854","epage":"2181 Vol. 4","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1424854&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"1912","punumber":"9744","publicationid":"1424854","doi":"10.1109\/WCNC.2005.1424854"},{"isbn":"0-7803-8907-7","py":"2005","spage":"77","abstract":"Low cost and reliable printing technologies are more and more attractive to flexible electronic industries for replacing traditional subtractive etched Cu in circuit creations.

Now, we have made progress towards these aims. The hardware platforms used to implement these systems encapsulate significant computation capability in a small form-factor, consume little power and have a small cost.

The propagation of streamers in atmospheric pressure gases is of interest in plasma remediation of toxic gases, ozone production and functionalization of surfaces. The air (or other gases) in these non-pristine environments is often contaminated with particles or aerosols having sizes of 10s to 100s mum. These particles may have varying degrees of conductivity, from metallic to classically dielectric. The intersection of propagating streamers with particles not only results in charging of the particles but can also significantly perturb the streamer dynamics due to loss of charge, electric field enhancement and secondary processes. The consequences of dielectric and metal dust particles on streamer dynamics in air and other gases were computationally investigated. As a base case, the interaction of well developed streamers with isolated particles will be discussed. We found that the characteristic timescale on which the particle charges depends on the rate of electron attachment. Using a 2-dimensional plasma hydrodynamics model with unstructured meshes the consequences of random and ordered collections of dust particles were also investigated while varying the particle sizes and polarity of the voltage (e.g., positive and negative streamers). Changes in the properties of the streamers will be discussed.

Resource uncertainty inhibits many future applications that require large amount of resources to be guaranteed at specific times and locations. In order to address the problem of resource uncertainty, these applications may need to reserve network resources in advance. However, in order to support percall advance reservation, the network must store, process, and access large volume of reservation data efficiently. In particular, the admission control functions must have fast and scalable access to these reservation data for making effective decisions regarding the acceptance and rejection of both immediate and future calls. In this paper, we propose a distributed reservation database architecture that features proactive processing and delivery of reservation data to admission control functions located in each radio base-station. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our architecture, we present results from a prototype experiment that compared the proposed proactive approach with the traditional query-based data delivery approach. With proactive approach, the response time of admission control was 20 times or more faster than traditional query-based approach in our experiments.","arnumber":"4024420","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Fast and Scalable Access to Advance Resource Reservation Data in Future Cellular Networks]]>","partnum":"4024420","pubtitle":"Communications, 2006.

Under light load condition (load less than 80%) the battery is being charged and in heavy load condition (load more than 100%) energy from battery is also utilized to feed extra power to the load. Along with load management, BESS provides the reactive power, harmonic and unbalanced load current compensation. The control of BESS is achieved using least mean square (LMS) based Adaline. The Adaline is used to extract the balance positive sequence real fundamental frequency component of load current. The switching of voltage source converter (VSC) working as BESS is achieved by forcing source currents to follow reference currents using hysteresis based PWM control.

In this investigation, wind turbine generators, photovoltaic panels, and storage batteries are used to build a grid-linked generation system which is optimal in terms of multiple criteria including cost, reliability, and emissions. Multidisciplinary design facilitates the decision maker to make more rational evaluations. A set of tradeoff solutions can be obtained using the multidisciplinary approach, which offers many design alternatives to the decision-maker. A customized particle swarm optimization algorithm is developed to derive these non-dominated solutions. A grid-linked hybrid power system is designed based on the proposed approach. Furthermore, due to the unpredictability of wind speed and solar insolation, autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models are adopted to reflect the stochastic characteristics of wind speed and solar insolation. Sensitivity studies are also carried out to examine the impacts of different weather conditions and economic rates.","arnumber":"4147980","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[PSO-Based Multidisciplinary Design of A Hybrid Power Generation System With Statistical Models of Wind Speed and Solar Insolation]]>","partnum":"4147980","pubtitle":"Power Electronics, Drives and Energy Systems, 2006.

We assumed that several sensor nodes are deployed randomly in a field, to form a sensor network and each sensor in the network sends its data in the form of packets to a single energy-rich sink node. We also assumed that each sensor node has reconfigurable fabric which can be configured by downloading a bitstream. In contrast to the contemporary work in energy management for sensor networks, we use an accurate analytical battery model to simulate the battery consumption of each node in the network. We have written several simulation models to study various sensor network parameters when the underlying nodes are adaptive in nature instead of traditional, non-adaptive processor based, fixed implementation. As the remaining battery-capacity of our RC based node decreases, it changes its behavior by reconfiguring itself to lower powered implementations successively, thereby extending the sensor network lifetime as a whole. Our results indicate that the network life is increased by up to five times and the number of packets generated by the sensor nodes and received at the sink node more than quadrupled for RC based nodes when compared to fixed processor based node implementation.","arnumber":"1515781","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Energy management in battery-powered sensor networks with reconfigurable computing nodes]]>","partnum":"1515781","pubtitle":"Field Programmable Logic and Applications, 2005.

One way to make better use of available land would be to allow institutions to install small windmills on their own properties.

Capturing CO<sub>2<\/sub> from industrial gas stream by aqueous alkanolamine solution is the most cost-effective technology available today. Monoethanolamine (MEA) has been commonly used in gas processing industry for decades. In recent years, a sterically hindered amine, 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP), has gained its popularity since it offers a higher absorption capacity and a lower energy consumption during regeneration compared to MEA. Blending MEA with AMP is predicted to combine all favorable characteristics of both solvents and overcome the unfavorable characteristics. To date, the feasibility of using this blended MEA-AMP has been investigated through fundamental studies, especially in the area of thermodynamics. This work focuses on another fundamental aspect, i.e. kinetics of aqueous MEA-AMP. The kinetic measurements were carried out in a wetted wall column under ranges of process conditions. The column made from a 100 mm-long stainless steel tubing was fitted inside a glass chamber where the temperature of absorption was precisely controlled. The reaction kinetics was interpreted in terms of overall rate constant. Results show that reaction kinetics of MEA-AMP vary with process parameters including mixing ratio of MEA and AMP and absorption temperature.","arnumber":"4057346","pubtype":"Conference Publications","title":"<![CDATA[Kinetics of CO2 Capture by Blended MEA-AMP]]>","partnum":"4057346","pubtitle":"EIC Climate Change Technology, 2006 IEEE","pdf":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4057346","epage":"6","mdurl":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4057346&contentType=Conference+Publications","publisher":"IEEE","rank":"1949","punumber":"4057290","publicationid":"4057346","doi":"10.1109\/EICCCC.2006.277216"},{"isbn":"1-4244-0493-2","py":"2006","spage":"6 pp.","abstract":"This paper presents an adaptive optimal control scheme for a grid independent photovoltaic (PV) system consisting of a PV collector array, a storage battery, and loads (critical and non-critical loads).

The HDP critic network is used in a PV system simulation study to train a neurocontroller to provide optimal control for varying PV system output energy and load demands. The emphasis of the optimal controller is primarily to supply the critical base load demand at all times.
